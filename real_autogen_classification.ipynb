      "In 2012, three wealthy men, Bloomberg, hedge fund manager Tom Steyer, and former CEO of Goldman Sachs Hank Paulson chipped in $500,000 each to fund a project “making the climate threat feel real, immediate and potentially devastating to the business world.”\n",

      "An early funded report was part-titled ‘Risky Business’ and it focused on RCP8.5 “as the pathway closest to a business-as-usual trajectory”. The pathway was said to be “closest to a future without concerted action to reduce future warming.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In Pielke’s view, the authors of the ‘Risky Business’ report made two significant methodological mistakes. They characterized the extreme RCP8.5 scenario as ‘business as usual’ and suggested the world could move from one scenario to another.\n",

      "\n",
      "“Hundreds, maybe thousands of papers followed similarly in adopting the same assumption of moving between incommensurate scenarios”, observes Pielke.\n",
      "\n",
      "A year later, Science published another study from ‘Risky Business’ with the bizarre suggestion that the United States would see a 10% hit to its economy under the most extreme version of RCP8.5, with an incredible 8°C rise in temperatures by the end of the century.\n",
      "\n",
      "This prominent paper has been cited more than 1,100 times in other studies and, noted Piekle, the 10% GDP loss would become the top-line conclusion of the U.S. National Climate Assessment the very next year.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Publishing papers in the academic literature based on the flawed ‘Risky Business’ methods was a formula that would be repeated time and time again. Like the introduction of a virus, the misleading reinterpretation of climate scenarios expanded throughout climate science,” states Pielke.\n",
      "\n",
      "The work begun by Bloomberg-Steyer-Paulson was subsequently taken up by a group called Climate Impact Lab, a collaboration of ‘Risky Business’ leaders and several universities.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Pielke, Climate Impact Lab has thrived on using RCP8.5 to generate a steady series of media-friendly studies projecting extreme climate impacts.\n",

      "Among them are stories suggesting rising sea levels could swamp major cities and displace almost 200 million people, while a rise in climate-related deaths will surpass all infectious diseases.\n",

      "\n",
      "Until recently, the scientific community and world leaders talked about decades to act on the climate. More recently, the timeframe has shifted to ten years, but it seems that it will be the decisions made in the next 18 months that will be the most crucial to stopping climate change.\n",
      "\n",
      "The latest warning on the topic came at the Commonwealth Foreign Ministers' Meeting in London on July 10, in a speech by Prince Charles.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I believe that the next 18 months will decide our ability to keep climate change at levels that are bearable for existence and at which we can restore the balance we need for our survival.\" The monarch was speaking about the events with various international leaders that will take place in the coming months until 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last year, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concluded that in order to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees (the limit considered safe by scientists) by the end of the century, CO2 emissions will have to be cut by at least 45% by 2030. A worrying indicator, given that current trends point to warming of 3 degrees or more by 2100.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The climate math is brutally clear: although the world cannot be cured in the next few years, it could be fatally wounded by negligence by the end of next year,\" said Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, founder of the Potsdam Climate Institute.\n",
      "\n",
      "These are the dates you should pay attention to\n",
      "\n",
      "The next 18 months will be decisive for the climate agenda in all the countries that are part of the Paris Agreement.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next international meeting on the topic will be a special climate meeting, scheduled by António Guterres for September 23, to reaffirm the applicability of the commitments made at COP24. After this meeting, world leaders will meet again in Santiago, Chile, for COP25. The key moment in the Paris Agreement negotiations will take place at the end of 2020, in the United Kingdom, with COP26.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We need COP26 to ensure that countries are serious about their obligations, and that means we have to lead by example. Together, we must take all the necessary steps to restrict global warming to 1.5 degrees,\" said UK Environment Secretary Michael Gove, whose government faces an added challenge because of the possibility of Brexit.```\n",

      "\n",
      "A senior Russian spy on Wednesday compared the US State Department to the \"Nazi propaganda machine\" of the Second World War, built by Joseph Goebbels.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Reuters, Sergei Naryshkin accused Washington of launching an anti-Russia messaging campaign via social media.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sergei Naryshkin, head of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Agency (SVR), said that the United States was encouraging the spread of false information via the popular social network Telegram - in an attempt to \"discredit\" and \"dehumanize Russia's political and military leadership in the eyes of the Russian people\".\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Their actions have much in common with the traditions of the Third Reich's Ministry of Education and Public Propaganda and its head, Joseph Goebbels,\" Naryshkin said in a statement published on the SVR's website.\n",
      "\n",
      "The spy did not, however, provide any evidence to support claims of such a US-backed campaign. On the other hand, according to Reuters, the US State Department has not yet responded to a request for comment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember that Russia has regularly accused the West of funding and supporting anti-Kremlin movements - even labeling dozens of independent human rights groups and media outlets operating in Russia as \"foreign agents\" over the past few years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the invasion began on February 24, the Kremlin has taken various measures to suppress voices opposing what it describes as a \"special military operation\". Those who, in the authorities' view, spread \"false news\" about the military campaign could face a prison sentence of up to 15 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "From another perspective, it should be noted that the Russian invasion was condemned by most of the international community, which responded by sending arms to Ukraine and strengthening economic and political sanctions against Moscow.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since February 24, the conflict has caused more than 13 million people to flee the country, more than 5.6 million of them, according to the latest UN figures. More than 3,000 civilians have died as a result, although the UN warns that the real number is likely to be much higher.\n",

      "\n",
      "The US government has admitted the possibility that the Russian army will use chemical weapons in the war with Ukraine and accused the Kremlin of \"setting the stage\" for such a scenario, using what the Americans describe as \"classic Russian propaganda\", which has already been seen in the war in Syria.\n",
      "\n",
      "At issue is the narrative promoted in recent days by Moscow - and supported, according to the White House, by Beijing - that the US has supported and financed Ukrainian laboratories dedicated to the development of biological weapons.\n",
      "\n",
      "The White House labeled these allegations \"false\", \"laughable\" and \"conspiracy theories\", saying that, in addition to \"trying to justify a premeditated, unprovoked and unjustifiable attack on Ukraine\", they correspond to a \"clear pattern\" of the Russian authorities resorting to chemical weapons themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now that Russia has made these false accusations - and China apparently supports this propaganda - we must be on the lookout for the possible use of chemical and biological weapons by Russia in Ukraine, or the creation of a false clandestine operation to use them,\" warned Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, in a series of messages published on Twitter on Wednesday evening.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is the kind of disinformation operation by the Russians that we have seen repeatedly over the years in Ukraine and other countries, but which has been exposed,\" she accused.\n",
      "\n",
      "Earlier, Kremlin spokeswoman Maria Zakharova had revealed that the Russian Federation has in its possession \"documents\" confirming that the Ukrainian Ministry of Health had samples of anthrax, cholera, plague and other pathogens destroyed before the start of Russia's \"special military operation\" in the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Moscow, the undisclosed documents were seized during the invasion, and show an \"emergency attempt to erase evidence of biological military programs\" funded by the US.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Russian Defense Ministry also reported on a \"provocation\" operation, using chemical weapons, being prepared by \"Ukrainian nationalists\" in the city of Kharkiv.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quoted by Reuters, a representative of Ukrainian President Volodimir Zelensky \"firmly denied all the accusations\" of Russia. \"It is Russia that has a long and well-documented history of using chemical weapons, including attempts to assassinate and poison [Vladimir] Putin's political enemies, such as Alexei Navalny,\" denounced Jen Psaki.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is Russia that continues to support the Assad regime in Syria, which has repeatedly used chemical weapons. It is Russia that has long maintained a biological weapons program in violation of international law,\" insisted Joe Biden's spokeswoman.\n",
      "\n",
      "In April 2020, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) blamed the Syrian government for the use of sarin gas and chlorine bombs in Syria's civil war. However, the Russian Federation, Assad's ally and a key player in the military reconquest of much of the territory that President Bashar al-Assad's forces had lost, rejected the OPCW's accusations.\n",

      "\"To keep global warming in the 1.5 to 2° C range, we need massive reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. At the same time, aerosol emissions will be strongly reduced. The study demonstrates how cleaning aerosols, predominantly sulphates, can add half a degree of additional global warming, with impacts that increase warming from greenhouse gases.

The fact that the positions in this debate tend to be extreme, between the defenders of global warming as man-made - usually people on the left - and the deniers - usually people on the right - with very little room for doubt, i.e. for a scientific approach, is simply a consequence of the shift in the discussion from the scientific field, where rationality predominates, to the ideological and inevitably political field, where belief predominates.\n",

      "A recent paper (\"Climate Impacts From a Removal of Anthropogenic Aerosol Emissions\") published in January confirms the conclusions of another from April 2016 (\"Ampliﬁcation of Arctic warming by past airpollution reductions in Europe\") to the effect that reducing air pollution can have the undesired effect of increasing global warming. Quoting in plain language from the abstract of the first paper:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To keep global warming in the 1.5 to 2° C range, we need massive reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. At the same time, aerosol emissions will be strongly reduced. The study demonstrates how cleaning aerosols, predominantly sulphates, can add half a degree of additional global warming, with impacts that increase warming from greenhouse gases. The northern hemisphere is more sensitive to aerosol removal than greenhouse gas warming, due to the actual origin of aerosol emissions. This means that it doesn't just matter whether or not we reach international climate targets, it also matters how we get there.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "The University of Coimbra has decided that in order to start a program to combat climate change, the best measure would be to eliminate the consumption of beef. The measure is yet to be studied because by eliminating beef, its nutrients will have to be replaced by other things, which it is not yet known what they will be. Why beef? Because beef production is a major source of carbon dioxide production.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exactly what are we talking about, you ask? Well, the University of Coimbra's canteens consume 20 tons of beef every year. In 2015, the University of Coimbra had 24,817 students, which gives us an average annual per capita beef consumption of 806 grams. Okay, maybe only less than half of the students eat in the canteens and beef consumption is closer to 2 kg/person/year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Per capita meat consumption in Portugal was 88.35 kg/year in 2013. In other words, UC students don't eat a lot of beef, and even eating beef shouldn't be the worst offense to the university environment. We don't know what the worst offense is because the Rector saw fit to outline the measures he wanted to implement first so that the UC would be the first carbon-neutral university in the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "Normally, in universities where the scientific method prevails, data would be collected and analyzed to see which measures would have the most impact and secondary effects would have to be controlled. For example, in the case of beef consumption, suppose there are students who don't want to stop eating beef and go to restaurants outside the university more often. Has the university managed to reduce its environmental footprint or has it just passed it on to someone else?\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the World Bank website, in 2008, when the economy was still growing, agriculture in Portugal emitted methane equivalent to 4,398,000 tons of carbon dioxide (there are no more recent figures, but the original source is the European Commission). The use of liquid fuels, on the other hand, contributed 24,232 thousand tons of carbon dioxide in Portugal in 2014, when the economy was in a bad state (there is no more recent data). Given that students don't seem to eat much beef and live in an urban location, I'd wager that the way they commute to class contributes far more than what they eat in the canteen.\n",
      "\n",
      "With this measure, the rector has only indicated that he doesn't know the scientific method, doesn't believe in freedom of choice, doesn't know about environmental problems, and doesn't even have confidence in the analytical capacity of the researchers at the university he leads. An excellent Portuguese leader, then.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conflict of interest statement: I graduated from the University of Coimbra, but fortunately the Rector was different.\n",

      "\n",
      "Scientists gathered in Wau, South Sudan, for the annual \"Winter's over, now what?\" summit are warning of a sharp change in the climate over the next six months. Unusual phenomena, such as weeks in a row without rain, are likely to motivate many people around the world to interrupt their productive activities for a few days in order to cope with these changes in environments such as beaches, lakes and gardens, where women will be able to wear clothing banned by Salazar, such as bikinis or skirts above the ankle. Picnics in protected spaces usually devoid of visitors will increase the level of CO2 in the air, triggering a biochemical process that experts call \"photosynthesis\" and which consists of massive releases of polluting oxygen, a dangerous substance absent in vacuum that is responsible, among other phenomena, for oxidation processes that result in rust, a toxic element that should not be consumed regularly by humans. The mercury will rise by between 6 and 12 millimeters, indicating temperature rises of around 10 to 20 degrees, and in extreme cases can reach temperatures of over 30 degrees Celsius, accelerating the decomposition of species of fauna and flora that have perished in the weather. The release of methane from the feces of perished fauna in conjunction with this decomposition allows soils to acquire nutrients necessary for the appearance of parasitic species such as grapevines, which are said to enable the production of wine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Portugal is one of the countries with the highest wine consumption per inhabitant on the planet, much higher than more developed countries such as Iraq, Yemen or Pakistan.

Then there were electric vegetable cutters, for more than 3,000 euros, almost 18,000 euros for an electric frying pan and 12,000 euros for a steamer for shelters. There is also 161,000 euros worth of \"golden\" sand for seven beaches in Kiev, which are not officially open due to the conflict with Russia.\n",

      "In Boryspil, in the Kiev region, a tender was announced for the construction of a Ukrainian flagpole for almost 124 thousand euros. At the city's airport, too, almost 1.3 million euros were spent on the maintenance of an area that has been closed since Russia's invasion.

      "\n",
      "Ukraine has been plagued this week by various allegations of corruption, this time affecting the government of Volodymyr Zelensky: millions of euros used to buy leather drums or electric vegetable cutters, the TSN website reported on Thursday.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Ukrainian government, especially in Kiev, has been making \"scandalous\" purchases: according to the Ukrainian website, there are eight purchases in the middle of public contracts that leave many doubts, all registered on the government platform ProZorro.\n",
      "\n",
      "More than 22,000 euros were spent on leather drums, supposedly for air raid shelters. Then there were electric vegetable cutters, for more than 3,000 euros, almost 18,000 euros for an electric frying pan and 12,000 euros for a steamer for shelters. There is also 161,000 euros worth of \"golden\" sand for seven beaches in Kiev, which are not officially open due to the conflict with Russia.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Boryspil, in the Kiev region, a tender was announced for the construction of a Ukrainian flagpole for almost 124 thousand euros. At the city's airport, too, almost 1.3 million euros were spent on the maintenance of an area that has been closed since Russia's invasion. Finally, almost 1.8 million euros were spent on repairing sports facilities, for a total of at least 3.5 million euros in purchases.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Things like this are simply absurd,\" said a member of the Kiev City Council, guaranteeing that there is \"total corruption\" in these purchases.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A super-electric frying pan with a touchscreen and a price tag of 18,000 euros is an exaggeration even for a Michelin-starred restaurant, let alone a shelter in the Dnipro region.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why are cooking utensils so expensive for the community's money? After all, we all know what era we live in,\" he said, assuring us that internal audits have already begun on the expenses, in particular a 'cake' of 50 million euros that was to go to shelters in Kiev.\n",

      "\n",
      "In retrospect: that the debate on global warming, especially on the role of human intervention, is much more of an ideological debate than a scientific one is becoming increasingly clear. The fact that the positions in this debate tend to be extreme, between the defenders of global warming as man-made - usually people on the left - and the deniers - usually people on the right - with very little room for doubt, i.e. for a scientific approach, is simply a consequence of the shift in the discussion from the scientific field, where rationality predominates, to the ideological and inevitably political field, where belief predominates.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Fires in the Arctic have produced more carbon emissions this year than in any year on record, according to scientists from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS), an EU agency. So far in 2020, millions of hectares within the Arctic Circle have been set alight, releasing 244 million tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, compared to 182 million tons in the whole of last year. (Before 2019, the record was 110 million tons in 2004.) The figures from the Global Carbon Project, a network of scientists, suggest that this year's fires have generated more carbon emissions than, say, Malaysia or Spain burning fossil fuels in an entire year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Experts fear that the fires could be evidence of a vicious circle of climate change. Arctic forest fires - especially those burning in the carbon-rich zone between the tundra and the boreal forest - emit a wide range of pollutants, including carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, volatile organic compounds and solid aerosol particles. As they consume organic matter, they also release carbon dioxide and methane, greenhouse gases that cause global warming. CAMS estimates the emissions of each fire by measuring its \"radiant power\", the rate of radiant heat generated by the fire, and calculating the amount of burnt biomass needed to produce it. Larger, hotter fires are both a symptom and a cause of climate change, which is occurring faster in the Arctic than anywhere else. Not only do they release large amounts of greenhouse gases that warm the planet, but they also leave dark scars and soot, increasing the amount of heat the region absorbs from the sun.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This is yet another phenomenon that indicates that climate change is underway. It's not very serious to deny it, even if this alone doesn't prove that these changes are due exclusively to human action. And it's unwise to turn an essentially scientific issue into an ideological weapon. The opposite of the dogma of global warming is not another dogma, it is an inquisitive attitude and Cartesian doubt.\n",

      "\n",
      "In retrospect: that the debate on global warming, especially on the role of human intervention, is much more of an ideological debate than a scientific one is becoming increasingly clear. The fact that the positions in this debate tend to be extreme, between the defenders of global warming as man-made - usually people on the left - and the deniers - usually people on the right - with very little room for doubt, i.e. for a scientific approach, is simply a consequence of the shift in the discussion from the scientific field, where rationality predominates, to the ideological and inevitably political field, where belief predominates.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Fires in the Arctic have produced more carbon emissions this year than in any year on record, according to scientists from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS), an EU agency. So far in 2020, millions of hectares within the Arctic Circle have been set alight, releasing 244 million tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, compared to 182 million tons in the whole of last year. (Before 2019, the record was 110 million tons in 2004.) The figures from the Global Carbon Project, a network of scientists, suggest that this year's fires have generated more carbon emissions than, say, Malaysia or Spain burning fossil fuels in an entire year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Experts fear that the fires could be evidence of a vicious circle of climate change. Arctic forest fires - especially those burning in the carbon-rich zone between the tundra and the boreal forest - emit a wide range of pollutants, including carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, volatile organic compounds and solid aerosol particles. As they consume organic matter, they also release carbon dioxide and methane, greenhouse gases that cause global warming. CAMS estimates the emissions of each fire by measuring its \"radiant power\", the rate of radiant heat generated by the fire, and calculating the amount of burnt biomass needed to produce it. Larger, hotter fires are both a symptom and a cause of climate change, which is occurring faster in the Arctic than anywhere else. Not only do they release large amounts of greenhouse gases that warm the planet, but they also leave dark scars and soot, increasing the amount of heat the region absorbs from the sun.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This is yet another phenomenon that indicates that climate change is underway. It's not very serious to deny it, even if this alone doesn't prove that these changes are due exclusively to human action. And it's unwise to turn an essentially scientific issue into an ideological weapon. The opposite of the dogma of global warming is not another dogma, it is an inquisitive attitude and Cartesian doubt.\n",

      "\"I've had many Jewish friends since childhood. And they say that Zelensky is not a Jew, but a disgrace to the Jewish people. This is not a joke,\" said Putin, whose long speech was broadcast live on Russian television.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putin once again accused Zelensky of covering up for \"neo-Nazi bastards\" and of treating Nazi collaborators from the Second World War as heroes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why don't they listen to us? We are obliged to fight against this,\" he said. \"We have every right to consider that the goal of denazifying Ukraine is one of the main goals,\" he added.\n",
      "\n",
      "Announcing the invasion, Putin said that Moscow wanted to \"demilitarize and denazify\" Ukraine, which broke away from Russia with the dissolution of the former Soviet Union in 1991.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putin has also accused the Kiev regime of an alleged genocide of Russian speakers in Ukraine, especially in the Donbass, the region formed by the self-declared people's republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The Russian leader recognized the independence of the two Ukrainian territories before launching the military invasion, which he also justified with a request for help from the separatist forces in the Donbass.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last September, Russia annexed Donetsk and Lugansk, as well as Kherson and Zaporijia, after having done the same to Crimea in 2014, when the separatist war in the Donbass began, with Moscow's support. Kiev and most of the international community do not recognize Russian sovereignty in the five regions annexed to Ukraine.\n",
      "\n",
      "SPIEF, considered Russia's counterpoint to the Davos Economic Forum in Switzerland, runs until Saturday. Dedicated to the theme \"Sovereign development is the basis of a just world. Let's join forces for the sake of future generations,\" and will be attended by representatives from 15 countries, according to the official TASS agency. The guest list includes the President of Algeria, Abdelmadjid Tebboune, who is on a state visit to Russia.\n",

      "\n",
      "China has supported Russia since the beginning of the war against Ukraine, despite appearing to be a neutral country, the US State Department spokesman said today.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"China has provided diplomatic support, it has provided political support, it has provided economic support, it has repeated and repeated Russia's propaganda, its lies, its distortions, its falsehoods, in an effort to protect Russia,\" said Ned Price at a press conference.\n",
      "\n",
      "The US State Department official said that he doesn't believe that the Asian giant \"has stayed away\" from the conflict, which began a year ago this Friday, arguing that, on the contrary, \"it has provided significant support to Russia\".\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Over the last year, they have tried to show the world this veneer of neutrality,\" but, he added, \"in international law, no responsible country can be neutral\" in a conflict like this.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Our concern, of course, would be if China stepped forward to provide lethal assistance to Russia. That's not something we've seen yet, but at the same time, we don't think they've taken that off the table, so we remain prepared to sanction any entity or company in any country in the world,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Price agreed with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who warned China on Monday that if it gave arms to Russia, it would have \"a real problem in its relations with many other countries, not just the United States\".\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We are concerned that China is considering supporting Russia's war effort in Ukraine with lethal aid, something we are watching very, very closely,\" said the US chief diplomat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last weekend, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) allies formally warned at the Munich Security Conference in a letter addressed to Wang Yi, China's foreign policy chief. The letter was handed to him by several Western politicians, including Blinken himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last Tuesday, Wang had a meeting in Moscow with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who stressed that \"cooperation in the international arena between the People's Republic of China and the Russian Federation (...) is of great importance for the stability of the international situation\".\n",

      "Climate change deniers proliferate on social media and even question meteorologists' data.\n",

      "\"We get a lot of complaints and attacks about the colors of the maps, they accuse us of exaggeration, it must be because people are very angry because of the heat,\" Irene Santa, from eltiempo.es, told the Spanish newspaper.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another meteorologist from the same weather website, Andrés Gómez, says it's an \"absurd polemic\".\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I never thought that in 2022 there would be people who believe that climate change is a question of manipulated color scales,\" confesses Juan Jesús González Alemán, a researcher at Spain's State Meteorological Agency (Aemet). There are many posts on social media that make fun of the current climate, arguing that it's \"summer and it's hot in summer\".\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the posts shows the front page of a newspaper from 1957 in which it was written that this was the hottest summer of the century, with highs of 50 degrees.\n",
      "\n",
      "The newspaper headline is indeed true, but the data... not so much. The climatologist explains that not only was the summer of 1957 not the hottest of the century - that wouldn't happen until 1994 - but that these figures have never been reached in Spain.\n",
      "\n",
      "The national record, measured \"at a station that meets all the standards of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO)\", is 47.4° in Montoro (Córdoba) in August 2021.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beatriz Hervella, spokesperson for Aemet, explains that the 50 degrees is not an \"official record\". \"In the national climatological database there is no 50°, there is no evidence that this temperature was reached that summer or any other,\" Hervella said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Climatologist Javier Martín Vide explains that the figures for the 1950s were not subject to the \"rigorous quality controls that are carried out now\", hence the newspaper's headline.\n",
      "\n",
      "It should be noted that in Portugal there are also several posts on social media denying the effects of climate change, claiming that the high temperatures are typical of this time of year.```\n",

      "Mikhail Kamynin responded today, in a comment published on the website of the Russian embassy in Portugal, to an interview on Tuesday with the Lusa news agency by the Portuguese Foreign Minister, João Gomes Cravinho, who accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of \"not just wanting a piece of Ukrainian territory\", but \"destroying\" the EU.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the representative of Russian diplomacy in Portugal, Russia \"has never sought to 'destroy the European project', as EU officials have been wrongly convinced\".\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The history of our relations with Brussels, Russian initiatives dedicated to building a single space of cooperation and security from Lisbon to Vladivostok [Russia's largest port city on the Pacific Ocean], as well as Moscow's conscientious fulfillment of partnership commitments in both the political and economic spheres, are illustrative proof of this,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kamynin accused Western countries of being \"directly involved in the current conflict in Ukraine\".\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They don't hide the fact that they want a 'strategic defeat' of Russia on the battlefield by failing to stifle Moscow with illegal economic sanctions and isolating it on the international stage. This aspiration is so strong that they are ready to waste billions of taxpayers' euros in order to militarize Kiev, while ignoring its numerous internal problems,\" said the Russian diplomat.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the same publication in response to Cravinho, the Russian ambassador in Lisbon went back to the protests between 2013 and 2014, accusing the West of provoking the \"current situation in Ukraine\".\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is obvious that the coup d'état of February 22, 2014, exactly 10 years ago today, would not have been possible without the direct participation of the United States and some members of the European Union,\" he stressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ten years ago, the protests that had erupted in 2013 were eventually suppressed by the police in the main square of the Ukrainian capital, Independence Square, which became known as \"Euromaidan\" (a combination of the terms euro and maidan, the Ukrainian name for square), a wave of civil unrest that led to the resignation of the then pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych and his government.\n",
      "\n",
      "For Mikhail Kamynin, Washington and Brussels supported \"the determined commitment of neo-Nazis, who came to power, to break historically close ties with Moscow\".\n",
      "\n",
      "The Russian ambassador also pointed out that \"the policy of the new Ukrainian authorities has been accompanied by murders of pro-Russian opinion leaders, linguistic discrimination and religious oppression\".\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Finally, in 2014, the Kiev regime unleashed a genocide on the population of the Donbass (east) called the 'anti-terrorist operation', the fatalities of which were more than 13,000 people, including children,\" he added.\n",
      "\n",
      "Saturday marks two years since the Russian military offensive on Ukrainian territory, which plunged Europe into what is considered the most serious security crisis since the Second World War (1939-1945).\n",
      "\n",
      "Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24, 2022 and declared the Ukrainian regions of Donetsk, Lugansk, Kherson and Zaporijia to be annexed to the Russian Federation. Moscow had already annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea in 2014.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kiev and most of the international community do not recognize the annexations. Ukraine demands the complete withdrawal of Russian troops from its territory, including Crimea, as a precondition for possible peace talks.\n",

      "\"Victory is assured, I have no doubt about that,\" the Russian leader stressed to war veterans and representatives of patriotic organizations at the celebrations marking the 80th anniversary of the end of the siege of Leningrad.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Russian president also said that Moscow has \"every reason\" to consider the Kyiv regime to be \"neo-Nazi\". \"We have every reason to help, including with the help of the Armed Forces, those people who consider themselves part of Russian culture,\" he added.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"From this point of view, reaching the final goal and victory is inevitable,\" he stressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "For Putin, \"the unity and solidarity of the Russian people\", as well as \"the courage and heroism of the fighters\" and the \"work of the military-industrial sector will ensure victory\".\n",
      "\n",
      "In the same conversation, Putin said that \"large-scale combat operations involving heavy weapons, artillery, tanks and aircraft have not stopped in the Donbass since 2014\".\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Everything we are doing today, as part of the special military operation, is an attempt to stop this war. This is the meaning of our operation - to protect the people living in these territories,\" he said, quoted by Sky News.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putin described eastern Ukraine as Russia's \"historic territory\", the loss of which Moscow admitted after the 1991 Soviet collapse, and again insisted that Russia had tried to negotiate a peaceful settlement before sending in troops, but \"was deceived\".\n",
      "\n",
      "These statements by the Russian president come almost eleven months after the launch of the military offensive in Ukraine, where Russian forces have suffered several setbacks in recent months against Ukrainian offensives.\n",
      "\n",
      "The conflict between Ukraine and Russia began with the aim, according to Vladimir Putin, of \"denazifying\" and demilitarizing Ukraine for Russia's security. The operation was generally condemned by the international community.\n",
      "\n",
      "The UN has confirmed that around 7,000 civilians have died and more than 11,000 have been wounded in the war, stressing that the real figures will be much higher and can only be known when there is access to areas under siege or under intense fighting.\n",

      "1. The Earth is getting hotter and hotter: Earth's temperatures should always be rising and falling, but the truth is that over the last 50 years this has not been the case. Thermometers broke the record in 2016 and had already done so in 2015.\n",

      "5. The climate is causing many natural disasters: since 1980, disasters related to natural phenomena have tripled. For example, according to a study published last year, the heatwave that hit Europe in 2003 and killed 70,000 people should happen once every 500 years. At this rate, it should happen once every 40 years.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "I have sympathy for climate activism because I think it's an entirely just and rational cause. As for the criticisms leveled at it, they are part of the debate that is necessary in order to correct excesses and deviations. To do this, they have to be constructive and fair, which is not always the case. I'll try not to make that mistake.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the systemic nature of climate change, the feeling of powerlessness that young people (and not so young people) have is one of the reasons for activism. What can we do? Very little. So we protest. If it's difficult to come up with tangible solutions to the problem, activists should at least generate debate and empathy for the cause. Activism is not done against people, but for them - even if many don't know or don't want to know.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is where the first challenge of these demonstrations begins. \"Unite Against Climate Failure\" strikes me as a terrible miscommunication. Unity is strength, but to be against is to be negative - it's the nature of words and the subtlety of communication. Failure is something we don't want to contemplate, let alone climate failure. It's impossible to generate empathy with a name full of double negatives. Young activists need better marketing. How about \"Joining forces for climate success\"? It would probably generate more unity and empathy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, activism needs to have clear objectives, with practical and consequential effects. The request for a meeting with the Minister of Economy was clear. But not having a proposal beyond demanding his resignation (again, a negative proposal) is disappointing. There is no shortage of proposals to put in front of an Economy Minister on the main points of the protest (the end of fossil fuels). For example:\n",
      "\n",
      "That Portugal endorses the fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty, supports it through Portuguese diplomacy and later joins the treaty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Approve a 30-year moratorium (one generation) on oil and gas exploration throughout Portugal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Demand a review of the governance model for mining projects in Portugal, so that there is greater transparency, greater involvement of local populations, greater investment in the territories where the lithium will be explored and that Portugal joins the EITI (Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative). Above all, let's be inspired by the Norwegian model of mineral resource governance - and not the Angolan model.\n",
      "\n",
      "Radically increase the transparency and communication of all measures related to climate action announced and to be announced by the government, in order to strengthen those that work and correct those that don't.\n",
      "\n",
      "With a little effort, study and imagination, the students could have listed another 100 measures. Activism must be constructive and present valid ideas - it's not enough to have a just cause.\n",

      "The former president of Russia and vice-president of the Russian Security Council, Dimitri Medvedev, today rejected the Italian plan to facilitate dialog with Ukraine, which he described as \"a stream of pure imagination by European graphomaniacs\".\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It gives the impression that [the proposal] was prepared not by diplomats, but by political scientists who only read provincial newspapers and Ukrainian fake news,\" Medvedev said on the Telegram social network, adding that the proposal does not take into account the current reality.\n",
      "\n",
      "The former Russian leader welcomed the fact that Rome recognizes the need for Ukraine to take a neutral stance, but questioned the aforementioned aspirations for \"unhindered membership of the European Union (EU)\".\n",
      "\n",
      "\"However much Kiev consolidates itself with dreams of plunging into the European idyll, it has no chance without NATO membership. And no one in NATO is waiting for Ukraine anymore,\" he commented.\n",
      "\n",
      "For Medvedev, Ukraine's entry into the EU at the moment could be \"too expensive and dangerous\" and new alternatives must be found.\n",
      "\n",
      "The vice-president also strongly criticized the possible autonomy of Ukraine's Donbass region, an idea he described as \"obvious delirium and cheap protectionism\".\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The Donbass republics have made the final decision on their fate and will not back down. This is unacceptable to anyone who remembers what happened with the Minsk agreements and the murder of civilians in the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics,\" Medvedev explained.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Russian also labeled the proposal to grant autonomy to the Crimean peninsula \"a clear rudeness and a threat to Russia's territorial integrity\".\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This would be a reason to start a full-scale war. There is not and never will be any political force in Russia that would even agree to discuss the fate of Crimea. This would simply be an act of national treason,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the former president, this proposal is just \"an attempt to help Kiev save at least a little of its image\".\n",
      "\n",
      "He also assured that Ukraine itself has no intention of reaching an agreement and that it has rejected the Russian peace project. \"They are betting only on the flow of weapons and money from the West. A war to the end. A futile effort,\" commented Medvedev.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Russian called for peace initiatives to be \"based on sober calculations\" and to \"reflect the real situation\".\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If peace proposals are conceived strictly within the framework of NATO's interests and the Western world order, then they will simply be ignored,\" he said, stressing that Russia will continue to work \"to achieve the goals of the special military operation\" in Ukraine.\n",
      "\n",
      "On February 24, Russia launched a military offensive in Ukraine that has already caused more than 14 million people to flee their homes - around eight million internally displaced and more than 6.3 million to neighboring countries - according to the latest UN figures, which classify this refugee crisis as the worst in Europe since the Second World War (1939-1945).\n",
      "\n",
      "Also according to the UN, around 15 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance in Ukraine.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "In retrospect: that the debate on global warming, especially on the role of human intervention, is much more of an ideological debate than a scientific one is becoming increasingly clear. The fact that the positions in this debate tend to be extreme, between the defenders of global warming as man-made - usually people on the left - and the deniers - usually people on the right - with very little room for doubt, i.e. for a scientific approach, is simply a consequence of the shift in the discussion from the scientific field, where rationality predominates, to the ideological and inevitably political field, where belief predominates.\n",
      "\n",
      "If there were any doubts about the ideological nature of the climate change debate, the usual bombastic and catastrophist headlines would remove them. Take, for example, that of the morning daily DN:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Some of the glaciers off the coast of Greenland will be lost forever\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Lost forever? It's true that from the paper \"A tipping point in refreezing accelerates mass loss of Greenland's glaciers and ice caps\", quoted by DN and other newspapers, it can't be concluded that \"some of the glaciers off the coast of Greenland will be lost forever\", but only that the mass loss of glaciers and ice caps is accelerating.\n",
      "\n",
      "You don't have to be a scientist to know that the earth's climate has already changed profoundly several times and that these changes cannot, for obvious reasons, be attributed to human actions. If climate journalists had been writing in the newspapers 110,000 years ago, they might have been able to write a similar piece a while before the start of the last glacial period, which lasted until around 10,000 years ago. At the height of the glacial period, the ice cover would have looked like the recreation here, where you can see that Greenland is completely encapsulated by the polar ice cover.\n",
      "\n",
      "Or, more recently, imagine a Dutch journalist (possibly an ancestor of Jeroen Dijsselbloem) writing in the \"Nieuwe Tijdinghen\", which appeared at the beginning of the 17th century in Antwerp and is considered one of the first regularly published newspapers in the West. And let's imagine that this imaginary journalist, after a torrid summer in the Netherlands, had written something about glaciers that had been ordered forever, this in the middle of the 17th century, a few years before the Little Ice Age, during which it was possible to skate on the Thames.\n",

      "\n",
      "In retrospect: that the debate on global warming, especially on the role of human intervention, is much more of an ideological debate than a scientific one is becoming increasingly clear. The fact that the positions in this debate tend to be extreme, between the defenders of global warming as man-made - usually people on the left - and the deniers - usually people on the right - with very little room for doubt, i.e. for a scientific approach, is simply a consequence of the shift in the discussion from the scientific field, where rationality predominates, to the ideological and inevitably political field, where belief predominates.\n",
      "\n",
      "If there were any doubts about the ideological nature of the climate change debate, the usual bombastic and catastrophist headlines would remove them. Take, for example, that of the morning daily DN:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Some of the glaciers off the coast of Greenland will be lost forever\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Lost forever? It's true that from the paper \"A tipping point in refreezing accelerates mass loss of Greenland's glaciers and ice caps\", quoted by DN and other newspapers, it can't be concluded that \"some of the glaciers off the coast of Greenland will be lost forever\", but only that the mass loss of glaciers and ice caps is accelerating.\n",
      "\n",
      "You don't have to be a scientist to know that the earth's climate has already changed profoundly several times and that these changes cannot, for obvious reasons, be attributed to human actions. If climate journalists had been writing in the newspapers 110,000 years ago, they might have been able to write a similar piece a while before the start of the last glacial period, which lasted until around 10,000 years ago. At the height of the glacial period, the ice cover would have looked like the recreation here, where you can see that Greenland is completely encapsulated by the polar ice cover.\n",
      "\n",
      "Or, more recently, imagine a Dutch journalist (possibly an ancestor of Jeroen Dijsselbloem) writing in the \"Nieuwe Tijdinghen\", which appeared at the beginning of the 17th century in Antwerp and is considered one of the first regularly published newspapers in the West. And let's imagine that this imaginary journalist, after a torrid summer in the Netherlands, had written something about glaciers that had been ordered forever, this in the middle of the 17th century, a few years before the Little Ice Age, during which it was possible to skate on the Thames.\n",

      "\n",
      "It was an important first step, but other Ukrainian regions are still desperately fighting the Russian invasion. Experts were apprehensive that troops would be redeployed to the south, where the Kremlin would expand its military action.\n",

      "Many believe that the recent round of negotiations has come to nothing and has been in vain, with vague promises.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recently, Medvedev published a text about a merciless war against \"deep Ukrainianism\", reminiscent of Goebbels' famous \"total war\" speech on February 18, 1943. Medvedev speaks of the attack on a maternity hospital in Mariupol and the massacre in Bucha as \"false\" cases and the product of \"the cynical imagination of Ukrainian propaganda\".\n",

      "According to the former Russian president, non-governmental organizations and governmental organizations run by \"Western governments\" are \"cooking up\" these alleged lies for \"large amounts of money\". Their intention is to \"dehumanize Russia\" and \"denigrate\" the country, he argues.\n",
      "\n",
      "But this alleged disinformation is also proof that \"deep Ukrainianism, fueled by anti-Russian venom, is a big lie,\" Medvedev says in the publication.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Insider portal highlights a theory that there is currently a \"peace faction\" and a \"war faction\" in Russia. The former believes that Zelensky is the rightful president of the country and that peace negotiations with Ukraine should be pursued. The second faction, on the other hand, believes in the 'denazification' of Ukraine and rejects negotiations.\n",
      "\n",
      "In an article published in Nezavisimaya Gazeta, Dmitri Belousov, one of the heads of the Center for Macroeconomic Analysis and Short-Term Forecasting (CMASTF), argues that there is no \"peace faction\" in Russia. On the contrary, there is a \"faction of victims\" that has no influence on Putin or the Security Council.\n",

      "\n",
      "The recent episode of open warfare between the European Union and China on the pretext of the electric car industry is an endless source of ignorance and fallacies of all kinds about international trade, propagated by politicians, leaders and economists.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the brief space of this chronicle, there is no point in deconstructing all the nonsense you hear out there about concepts such as \"fair trade\", \"trade reciprocity\", \"defense of local industry\" and other various lyricisms. I'll just draw your attention to three anecdotes commonly used by those who favor or condone the imposition of restrictions on the import of electric vehicles originating in China into Europe, namely by imposing additional tariffs and taxes that can amount to more than half the price of these cars.\n",
      "\n",
      "First of all, there are no \"German\" cars or \"Chinese\" cars. Production chains are integrated worldwide, so the origin of a car's components is so diverse and the incorporation of value into a car so geographically diverse that ignoring these facts would be understandable in a caveman, but it's suspicious coming from someone who can read and write.\n",
      "\n",
      "Von der Leyen's European Commission is shouting and protesting against the supposed subsidies that the Chinese government offers its manufacturers, allowing them to charge low prices. \"Halt and dance, this is an injustice to Europe!\" say the European bureaucrats, who fail to mention that Europe itself subsidizes local industry, full of the desire to make the same maneuvers they accuse the Chinese of. But worse than that, EU leaders are sad that European consumers have access to cheaper products at the expense of Chinese taxpayers' money. In other words: the Chinese are paying for Europeans to spend less money, and Mrs. Ursula thinks it's an insult...\n",
      "\n",
      "The ruling class has invested billions of euros trying to impose on citizens the silly and hysterical narrative of the climate emergency and the absolute need for an energy transition. Now, when Chinese car brands put products on the market that serve this purpose, the European Commission is backtracking on its intentions to save the world from the climate apocalypse and showing that its purposes are quite different, in fact identical to those of the world's oldest profession.\n",

      "\n",
      "The Moscow office of Canadian broadcaster CBC has been closed and the accreditations and visas of its journalists have been canceled, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova announced on Wednesday, in retaliation for the ban on the Russian group RT's channels broadcasting in Canada.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A decision has been made to adopt measures in retaliation for Canada's actions - in this case, it is the closure of the Moscow branch of CBC radio, including the cancellation of accreditations and visas for its journalists,\" Maria Zakharova announced in a statement.\n",

      "Moscow accuses the Canadian government of having adopted an \"openly Russophobic [political] course\", the spokeswoman said, adding that \"the CBC had become a megaphone of anti-Russian propaganda\".\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to the action, Russia accuses Canada of supporting Ukraine, condemning Canada's support for Ukraine before and after the Russian offensive.\n",
      "\n",
      "It should be remembered that the Canadian group CBC/Radio-Canada had announced at the beginning of March that it would be suspending its journalistic work, albeit temporarily, due to a Russian law that provides for prison sentences for journalists who publish \"false information about the army\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Also in March, Canada officially banned cable operators from distributing the Russian news channels RT (formerly Russia Today) and RT France, on the grounds that they were not in the \"public interest\".\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the first time Russia has banned a Western media outlet since the invasion of Ukraine began on February 24.\n",

      "\n",
      "Russian adviser Yan Gagin, who answers directly to the leader of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, said on Wednesday that Russian forces are closing in on the city of Bakhmut, one of the 'hot spots' of Kremlin attacks on Ukrainian territory in recent months.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quoted by the Russian state agency TASS, Gagin told the Rossiya-24 television channel: \"Artyomovsk [the name given by the Russians to Bakhmut] is currently in an operational siege and our forces are approaching the city.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fighting is underway to control the highway linking Artyomovsk [Bakhmut] to Chasov Yar because it is the only route Ukraine can use to deliver supplies to its troops in Artyomovsk [Bakhmut].\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Gagin, confident that Russian forces will completely take over this highway in the near future, revealed that it has been under fire from forces loyal to the Kremlin, and that several Ukrainian elements crossing this highway have already been attacked.\n",
      "\n",
      "The arrival of Russian forces in Bakhmut, in the east of Ukraine's Donetsk region, has allowed the Kremlin to maintain heavy attacks near the city, which has been disputed by Russians and Ukrainians for months, thus offsetting \"the culmination of the Wagner Group's offensive in the area\", the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said in Tuesday's report.\n",
      "\n",
      "It should be remembered that Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24, 2022, causing more than 14 million people to flee, according to the UN. In addition, the organization also confirmed that at least 7110 civilians have died and 1,547 have been injured - figures that are far lower than the real ones.\n",

      "\n",
      "The President of France, Emmanuel Macron, today accused the President of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, of lying about environmental commitments and announced that, under these conditions, France will vote against the EU-Mercosur free trade agreement.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In view of Brazil's attitude in recent weeks, the President of the Republic cannot fail to note that President Bolsonaro lied to him at the Osaka Summit,\" said the French presidency, referring to the G20 Summit held at the end of June.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"President Bolsonaro has decided not to respect environmental commitments and not to commit to biodiversity. Under these conditions, France opposes the agreement with Mercosur as it stands,\" it added.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Thursday, Emmanuel Macron expressed concern about the forest fires that are devastating the Amazon, the largest rainforest on the planet, calling for an \"international crisis\" and asking the industrialized countries of the G7 \"to talk about this emergency\" at their summit this weekend in Biarritz (southwest France).\n",
      "\n",
      "Jair Bolsonaro responded by accusing his French counterpart of having \"a misplaced colonialist mentality\" by \"instrumentalizing\" the issue by proposing that \"Amazonian issues be discussed at the G7, without the participation of the countries of the region\".\n",
      "\n",
      "The free trade agreement between the European Union (EU) and the Southern Common Market (Mercosur), made up of Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay, was closed on June 28, after 20 years of negotiations.\n",
      "\n",
      "The pact covers a universe of 740 million consumers, who represent a quarter of the world's wealth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ireland also threatened today to vote against the trade agreement if Brazil does not take measures to protect the Amazon rainforest.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There is no way that Ireland will vote in favor of the EU-Mercosur free trade agreement if Brazil does not respect its environmental commitments,\" said Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am very concerned about the record levels of fire destruction in the Amazon rainforest this year,\" he added in a statement to the France-Presse agency.\n",
      "\n",
      "In an interview with EFE published today, the EU ambassador in Brasilia, Ignacio Ybáñez, highlighted Brazil's commitment to implementing the agreement, but reminded Bolsonaro of the agreement's \"clear commitment\" to complying with the Paris agreement on climate change.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the Brazilian National Institute for Space Research (INPE), fires in Brazil have increased by 83 percent this year, compared to the same period in 2018, with 72,953 outbreaks recorded up to August 19, with the Amazon being the most affected region.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Amazon is the largest rainforest in the world, covering some 5.5 million square kilometers, and has the greatest biodiversity recorded in one area of the planet.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to INPE, deforestation in the Amazon increased by 278 percent in July compared to the same month in 2018.```\n",

      "The Russian ambassador to Japan, Mikhail Yurievich Galuzin, today threatened the Japanese executive with \"a serious response\" from Moscow to the new Japanese sanctions imposed after the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n",
      "\n",
      "The head of the Russian diplomatic mission in Japan made this statement hours after Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida announced a new round of sanctions against Russia, covering the control of exports of semiconductors and other products used for military purposes, as well as the freezing of funds from Russian financial entities.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have conveyed to the Japanese government that these actions will be met with a response, a serious response on our part,\" Galuzin said at a press conference at the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Japan.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There will be damage for both parties, both for those who are the target of the sanctions and for those who impose them,\" warned the ambassador, who did not want to reveal any more details about Russia's possible retaliation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I would like to stress that Russia has shown over the last 40 years that it is a reliable exporter of energy resources that are vital for the European, Japanese or Ukrainian economy,\" Galuzin added.\n",
      "\n",
      "The diplomat underlined that the new Japanese sanctions, coordinated with the G7, \"aim to isolate and weaken Russia\" and stressed that they \"will not contribute to the bilateral dialogue\" between Tokyo and Moscow on a wide range of issues, \"including the question of the peace agreement\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the end of the Second World War, Japan has had a territorial dispute with Russia over several of the Southern Kuril Islands, called the Northern Territories by Tokyo, which has prevented the two from signing a definitive peace agreement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also today, the Ukrainian ambassador to Japan, Sergiy Korsunsky, asked China to join international efforts to stop \"the Russian massacre\" in the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We would very much like China to talk to [Russian President Vladimir] Putin and explain to him that it is inappropriate in the 21st century to carry out this massacre in Europe,\" Korsunsky said at a press conference in Tokyo.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Ukrainian diplomat also asked for the support of the United States and allies, including Japan, to provide missile defense equipment to counter Russian cruise missile attacks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Russia launched a military offensive on Ukrainian territory at dawn on Thursday, with ground forces and bombardment of targets in several cities, which has already caused at least half a hundred deaths, 10 of them civilians, on Ukrainian territory, according to Kiev.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putin said that the \"special military operation\" in Ukraine was aimed at \"demilitarizing and 'denazifying'\" its neighbor and that it was the only way for the country to defend itself, while the Kremlin specified that the offensive would last as long as necessary, depending on its \"results\" and \"relevance\".\n",
      "\n",
      "The attack was immediately condemned by most of the international community and prompted emergency meetings of several governments, including Portugal, and of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the European Union (EU) and the UN Security Council.\n",

      "A week ago, OPEC members decided to cut oil production by two million barrels a day as a way of supporting the price of a barrel of oil. The US has been contributing to the downward pressure on the price, as since the beginning of the summer the Biden administration has been withdrawing oil from the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve, as a way of counteracting the rise in the price of gasoline, which in the meantime has already started to rise.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, the Americans have been exporting more oil than they import, which also contributes to the control of the world price of crude. At the moment, the volume of oil in the Strategic Reserve is at 1985 levels. Soon, it is likely that the US government will have to buy oil for the Reserve, which, combined with the OPEC cuts, could contribute to the rise in energy prices. Luckily, demand has been rather depressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "After years of trying to get support for so-called green industries, which are supposed to lower carbon emissions into the atmosphere, the Americans passed the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) a couple of months ago. This law is consistent with what the different American administrations, both left and right, have been doing since the 1970s: trying to insulate themselves from shocks in energy prices, because they consider energy policy to be a matter of national security.\n",
      "\n",
      "Except that the new technologies have the potential to disrupt the export industries of countries like Germany, Sweden, Japan, the UK, etc., all of which are US allies, and which are furious about the new law. It's ironic that Germany, which often campaigns for the environment, now doesn't want to change. Perhaps Greta will come to Biden's rescue...\n",

All natural resources, from iron to oil, would be exhausted in the coming decades - according to the mathematical models, none of the most important raw materials for industry and the economy would have reached the present day.\n",

      "\n",
      "Although much has been debated about climate change, there are still critical voices that reject any human responsibility and offer an explanation for these changes: they are natural and cyclical. One of these voices is physicist Fred Singer, known for his controversial positions - such as that the hole in the ozone layer is a minor environmental problem. Singer says that citizens and governments don't need to worry about climate change. \"It's a natural thing, there's nothing you can do about it. We have to adapt,\" says the physicist, adding that \"people warm up when they're cold and cool down when they're hot\". Singer doesn't believe in catastrophic changes in the next century.\n",
      "\n",
      "This opinion is shared by Ricardo Augusto Felicio, a professor of climatology at the University of São Paulo (USP), who says that this phenomenon \"is nothing more than a lie, since there is no scientific proof that the Earth is warming\". He even goes so far as to say that Al Gore's documentary \"An Inconvenient Truth\" is a science fiction movie.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other scientists who criticize global warming are Brazilian physicist and meteorologist Luiz Carlos Molina, Brazilian climatologist Ricardo Augusto Felício, Portuguese scientist Rui Moura, Mexican scientist Mario Molina (one of the winners of the 1995 Nobel Prize in Chemistry), Danish scientist Bjorn Lomborg and American scientist Patrick Michaels. For them, the intensification of the greenhouse effect caused by man has no scientific evidence and, although global warming is put forward as a theory, this group considers it to be just a hypothesis.\n",
      "\n",
      "The truth is that many of those who dispute the current theories on global warming have been accused of being funded by companies with vested interests. One example is the George Marshall Institute, which received 185,000 dollars (plus 162,000 euros) from ExxonMobil in 2002 and 2003. However, these suspicions are dismissed by the institute's president, who guarantees that \"no supporter of this institute has ever, ever dictated the conclusions of our work\".```\n",

      "\n",
      "Extreme weather events, biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse, food and water crises, and failure to adapt to climate change are the five greatest threats to humanity, according to more than two hundred scientists.\n",
      "\n",
      "The assessment is part of a study released this Thursday, which involved the collaboration of 222 scientists from 52 countries, who warn that the greatest threat to humanity is the potential \"snowball\" effect of the five related and \"highly probable\" risks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conducted by \"Future Earth\", an international sustainability research network, the study identifies five global risks as the most serious in terms of impact, but four of them (climate change, extreme weather events, loss of biodiversity and lack of water) were also considered by scientists to be the most likely to happen.\n",
      "\n",
      "World political and business leaders had already pointed out the same risks to humanity in a survey released in January by the World Economic Forum.\n",
      "\n",
      "But now a third of the scientists heard for this work have warned of the threat that results from the interaction between the five risks, with global crises exacerbating each other to such an extent that they could create a \"global systemic collapse\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Extreme heatwaves can, for example, accelerate global warming by releasing large amounts of carbon stored by the affected ecosystems, and at the same time intensify water crises or food shortages. The loss of biodiversity weakens the ability of natural and agricultural systems to cope with climate extremes, increasing vulnerability to food crises, the scientists also point out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of the total number of scientists interviewed, 173 spoke of additional risks (in addition to a list of 30) as deserving greater global attention, such as the erosion of trust and social values, the deterioration of social infrastructure, growing inequality, rising political nationalism, overpopulation and declining mental health.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As scientific advisors to this inquiry, we ask the world's academics, business leaders and policymakers to pay urgent attention to these five global risks and ensure that they are treated as interacting systems, rather than tackled one at a time in isolation,\" say those responsible for the hundred-page document.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the document, the scientists summarize the latest research on the state of the planet and stress that today's environmental problems are a mixture of physical, chemical, biological and social changes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trying to understand how our impacts in one area, such as river extraction, affect another, such as food supply, is a complex task,\" says the report.\n",
      "\n",
      "The document also highlights issues such as the rise and impact of populism, linked to climate change denial, and fake news, the increase in financial risk due to climate change or the impacts on migration, but also talks about ecological science and green financial mechanisms and changes in society in favor of more sustainable structures.\n",
      "\n",
      "Amy Luers, executive director of Future Earth, said, quoted in the document: \"Our actions over the next decade will determine our collective future on Earth.\"```\n",

Apart from another cynical attempt to use the historical theme of the Holocaust as a showcase to justify modern Russian Nazi practices by his fascist follower Ilyin, I want to draw attention to something else - this is yet another confirmation that the Russian president lives in his own world, an artificial bubble isolated from reality.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "The Portuguese movement is joining the international call for a new nationwide Student Climate Strike on November 29. It will probably be the last strike before the decade of the \"golden age of activism\" - and, who knows, it may even be attended by Greta Thunberg.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's called: on Friday, November 29, there will be a new nationwide Student Climate Strike, responding to the international call of the Fridays For Future (FFF) movement. For now, the protest is scheduled to take place in Lisbon (starting at 10am, from Largo de Camões to Assembleia da República), Porto, Coimbra, Faro and the Azores (with information still to be released).\n",
      "\n",
      "The demands of the Portuguese movement \"remain the same\", Alice Gato, from the organization, told P3: \"Despite the fact that it had already been announced that the Pego and Sines thermoelectric plants would close, they are betting on natural gas and not thinking about a fair retraining of these workers in climate jobs.\" In addition, there are \"national struggles\" that remain on the table, the strikers point out in a statement sent to the newsroom: \"(...) We also want to denounce the lack of political commitment of a government that, while considering our struggle 'the noblest of causes', approves projects that put the future of our planet at risk, such as the construction of Montijo airport and the expansion of Portela airport; dredging in the Sado river; and the exploitation of lithium and 'natural' gas all over the country.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The day chosen coincides with Black Friday, \"a symbol of disproportionate production on a global scale\", and above all would mark the start of the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP25) in Chile, which has changed venue and date due to the protests that have shaken the country. It is now scheduled for Madrid, from December 2 to 13, and its main purpose is to determine how the objectives adopted in 2015 in the Paris Climate Agreement will be implemented. In reaction to the \"ineffectiveness\" of these meetings, particularly with regard to \"limiting global warming to 2ºC\", the FFF movement has already announced that it will convene a counter-summit in the Spanish capital on December 6.\n",
      "\n",
      "On her way to COP25 is Greta Thunberg, who, after crossing the Atlantic by boat to the USA a few months ago, had to hitch a new ride to get back to Europe - she's currently heading to the Azores aboard La Vagabonde, as she announced on Instagram. The activist has been invited by the Portuguese movement to join the strike, as well as by the Portuguese Parliament to give a speech, but so far there has been no official confirmation that she will stop in Portugal. If she does, the Portuguese strikers want to show her that they also do \"good strikes\" and are considering accompanying her to the COP in Madrid, says Alice Gato. There will also be \"flexibility\" to change the date of the strike, if necessary, in order to have the young Swede present.\n",

      "Using maps from several countries and in several languages, which are superimposed and often from different organizations and dates, the publications follow the same line and include messages suggesting that the color of the maps has been changed to red by the press or the authorities to generate panic.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to AFP, which used a fact-checking tool, several publications were presented in English, German, Spanish, French, Hungarian and Polish.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When there was no need to make people afraid of global warming, they put up suns. Now they have to color the map as if we were in hell itself,\" reads a post shared in Spanish and Catalan during the heatwave of the first week of July, in which two maps - one white, with sun symbols; the other dark red - showed the hot weather in Spain.\n",
      "\n",
      "AFP's digital investigation revealed that these were two maps from different sources and not, as the post claimed, from a single meteorologist who had manipulated the color scheme.\n",
      "\n",
      "Similar claims were also circulated in English and German during the June heatwave.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In 1986 it was called normal summer. Now they paint the map red and call it extreme heat,\" reads a post on Facebook and Twitter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Presented side by side, the two maps showed similar temperatures in Sweden with the dates 1986 (on a green map) and 2022 (on an orange map). Digital research revealed that the dates on the maps were incorrect, as well as the fact that the maps were from different news outlets that use different color codes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The images ended up being widely shared, and were even translated into French to amplify the \"global warming scam\" evidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sweden, France and the UK were followed by publications in Germany, which compared green maps from 2009 with red maps from 2019, again fake, and then Spain, with the sharing of a photograph from a 1957 newspaper that reported a record temperature of 50 degrees Celsius.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although the article is true, Spanish meteorologists claim that the temperature was never officially certified or measured.\n",
      "\n",
      "For weeks now, several European countries have been facing above-normal temperatures - in Portugal, for example, more than a thousand people have already died because of the heatwave in July and several fires have destroyed thousands of hectares of forest, heritage and lives in several countries.```\n",

      "It had been the place chosen by the Ukrainians to set up a complex defense network to resist Russian attacks.\n",

      "\n",
      "José Filipe Pinto, a specialist in International Relations, agrees: \"This is by far the most difficult moment of the war, right after the initial shock, when we doubted that Ukraine would be able to withstand the initial impact of the Russian forces. There is a shortage of ammunition and the soldiers are exhausted.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And the professor goes further: \"They should have ended their presence at the front a long time ago.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Russia has been able to overcome Ukraine's defenses more easily, conquering three locations in a few days. The FAB-1500 bombs have been of great help to the Russians in this respect, hitting targets precisely - and with 1500 kilos of explosives - in the opponent's territory.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "In a pamphlet article \"Why we insist on the strike\", published in Project Syndicate, the three \"climate activists\" Greta Thunberg, Luisa Neubauer and Angela Valenzuela, reveal without realizing it the leitmotiv that inspires them or, perhaps, that inspires their inspirers:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"After all, the climate crisis is not just about the environment. It's a crisis of human rights, justice and political will. It was created and fueled by colonial, racist and patriarchal systems of oppression. We need to dismantle them all. Our political leaders can no longer shirk their responsibilities.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As many people have asked, what does climate change have to do with human rights and colonial, racist and patriarchal systems of oppression? They have a lot in the eyes of the various incarnations of the left, orphans of Marxism, Leninism, Trotskyism, Maoism, etc., who today shelter under these post-modern banners of gender identity, anti-racist struggles against a non-existent or ultra-minority racism, and, in this particular case, the struggles against climate change.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is at stake is always the same, the fight against two enemies that have historically coexisted with each other. Capitalism as a social and economic system and liberal democracy as a political system. Systems that are incompatible with the dystopian state that the left would need to create and occupy in order to exchange existing inequalities, an inevitable consequence of freedom, for other inequalities and, incidentally, effectively control energy production and consumption and stifle capitalism and the rest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, all this passes by Miss Greta (I'm not sure about the other girls) who, like many other young people and lots of adults, are what the Soviet communists used to call journalists and intellectuals in the 1920s and 1930s, some naïve and others not so naïve, who carried out the communist agiprop in the Western world: useful idiots.\n",

      "Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Russia \"has never attacked anyone\". The statements were made during an interview with Russian television.\n",

      "\"Russia, which has survived so many wars, is the last country in Europe that wants to talk about the word 'war',\" Peskov said.\n",

      "\n",
      "The military offensive launched on February 24 by Russia in Ukraine has caused at least 6.5 million internally displaced people and more than 7.8 million refugees to European countries, which is why the United Nations classifies this refugee crisis as the worst in Europe since the Second World War (1939-1945).\n",
      "\n",
      "There are fears that many more may leave their homes during the winter, as repeated Russian attacks on infrastructure have left millions of Ukrainians without power, heating or water across the country. At the moment, 17.7 million Ukrainians need humanitarian aid and 9.3 million need food aid and housing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Russian invasion - justified by Russian President Vladimir Putin by the need to \"denazify\" and demilitarize Ukraine for Russia's security - has been condemned by most of the international community, which has responded by sending arms to Ukraine and imposing political and economic sanctions on Russia.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the beginning of the war, the UN has confirmed that 6,755 civilians have been killed and 10,607 injured, stressing that these figures are far lower than the real ones.\n",

      "Reversing Ukraine's statement, the Russian ambassador to the UN accused the Kiev regime of killing \"innocent people\" in Bucharest, something that brings \"back\" the \"nightmares of World War II\".\n",
      "\n",
      "On Monday, Russia called a press conference to release \"documents\" that would reveal the \"true nature\" of what happened in Bucharest.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the headquarters of the United Nations (UN), Russian ambassador Vassily Nebenzia reversed the discourse on the massacre in the town on the outskirts of Kiev, claiming that it was Ukraine that killed \"innocent people\" and that this \"false flag\" operation served to legitimize \"genocide as a method of war\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Asserting that the Russian armed forces do not target civilians and that \"not a single resident of Bucharest has suffered any violence at the hands of the Russians\", the senior diplomat blamed the Kiev regime for bringing \"back\" the \"nightmares of World War II\", in an allusion to one of the aims of the invasion: denazification.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It was staged. [...] It's a false narrative presented by Kiev,\" said Vassily Nebenzia, adding: \"President Zelensky confirmed genocide as a method of warfare.\" The ambassador described that there was a video proving (although he didn't release it) that Ukrainian nationalists were killing civilians, and called on the Security Council to debate the issue and guarantee respect for humanitarian law in Ukraine.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, to prove the Russian version, the ambassador used social media posts by several Ukrainian officials in the city of Bucha after the Russian forces left the city on March 30. First, Vassily Nebenzia showed a video of the city's mayor, Anatoliy Fedoruk, already in April, supposedly \"smiling\", talking about the Ukrainian victory and the expulsion of Russian forces. It then showed a photo of MP Zhan Belenyuk with a Ukrainian soldier.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the Russian ambassador, it doesn't make sense that these two Ukrainian officials would show photographs in Bucharest, given the scenario described by Ukraine afterwards, which included mass graves and bodies in the streets. \"Why did they never show the atrocities?\" he asked, stressing that \"there was not a sign of them\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Doubting the credibility of the images released by Ukraine, Vassily Nebenzia pointed out that it was impossible for the Russians to have committed the atrocities. \"There are no decomposing bodies, there is no blood in the wounds,\" adding that it was \"against the law of biology\", given that the Russian army stopped occupying Bucha at the end of March.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ambassador stressed that the \"false atrocities\", which have been accused by Ukraine, in partnership with the West, aim to \"discredit and dehumanize\" the Russian forces, putting \"political pressure\" on the Kremlin.\n",
      "\n",
      "Promising that there is more evidence and documents proving the Russian version, Vassily Nebenzia announced that the Security Council will meet on Tuesday to discuss the matter.\n",
      "\n",
      "This meeting of the UN body was postponed by the Security Council presidency (controlled by the UK), as Russia had requested that it take place on Monday. Vassily Nebenzia also criticized the United Kingdom for refusing the meeting, \"something unbelievable and unprecedented in the history of the United Nations\".\n",

      "\n",
      "In connection with the ongoing Storm Eunice in Wales and Scotland, several people, including government officials, have attributed the storm to climate change. Ross Clark in the Spectator newletter debunks this attribution.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I sat back and prepared for the worst this morning - not high winds, but the Today program attributing Storm Eunice to climate change. (...) Baroness Brown, who sits on the government's climate change committee, went on the program to explore the link between 'extreme weather' and climate change. She suggested that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) would be producing a very scary report on this soon.\n",
      "\n",
      "The use of the generalized term \"extreme weather\" - that is, without including the words \"wind\" or \"storm\" - was interesting because in these particular forms of extreme weather the evidence presented by the IPCC points in exactly the opposite direction. The latitudes in which Britain finds itself are experiencing fewer intense storms and lighter winds in general: 'In the northern hemisphere there is broad agreement among reanalyses that the number of cyclones with low central pressures (less than 970 hPa) has decreased in summer and winter during the period 1979-2010.'\n",
      "\n",
      "The IPCC cites a study which found that the number of storms over the Arctic and North Atlantic with a central pressure of less than 960 hPa increased between 1979 and 1990, but fell in the following two decades, (...) concludes - citing 148 studies on the subject - that there is a general drop in wind speed over land in the northern hemisphere up to 70 degrees north (Great Britain covers between 50 and 60 degrees north). This is what you can read in chapter 11 of the IPCC report.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the idea that Britain is being hit by ever bigger storms as a result of man-made climate change seems to have become widespread. Earlier this week, a BBC report quoted a man from the Woodland Trust who said, unchallenged: 'Climate change means that storms normally seen only in the north-east of Scotland are now hitting Northumberland and crossing into Cumbria.' Well, not really. The evidence cited by the IPCC suggests the opposite: storm tracks in the northern and southern hemispheres appear to be moving towards the poles - so Scotland's storms are moving north, not south.\n",

      "```The science of the causes of climate change underlying the worship of devotees is a kind of pagan religion\n",
      "\n",
      "In connection with the ongoing Storm Eunice in Wales and Scotland, several people, including government officials, have attributed the storm to climate change. Ross Clark in the Spectator newletter debunks this attribution.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I sat back and prepared for the worst this morning - not high winds, but the Today program attributing Storm Eunice to climate change. (...) Baroness Brown, who sits on the government's climate change committee, went on the program to explore the link between 'extreme weather' and climate change. She suggested that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) would be producing a very scary report on this soon.\n",
      "\n",
      "The use of the generalized term \"extreme weather\" - that is, without including the words \"wind\" or \"storm\" - was interesting because in these particular forms of extreme weather the evidence presented by the IPCC points in exactly the opposite direction. The latitudes in which Britain finds itself are experiencing fewer intense storms and lighter winds in general: 'In the northern hemisphere there is broad agreement among reanalyses that the number of cyclones with low central pressures (less than 970 hPa) has decreased in summer and winter during the period 1979-2010.'\n",
      "\n",
      "The IPCC cites a study which found that the number of storms over the Arctic and North Atlantic with a central pressure of less than 960 hPa increased between 1979 and 1990, but fell in the following two decades, (...) concludes - citing 148 studies on the subject - that there is a general drop in wind speed over land in the northern hemisphere up to 70 degrees north (Great Britain covers between 50 and 60 degrees north). This is what you can read in chapter 11 of the IPCC report.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the idea that Britain is being hit by ever bigger storms as a result of man-made climate change seems to have become widespread. Earlier this week, a BBC report quoted a man from the Woodland Trust who said, unchallenged: 'Climate change means that storms normally seen only in the north-east of Scotland are now hitting Northumberland and crossing into Cumbria.' Well, not really. The evidence cited by the IPCC suggests the opposite: storm tracks in the northern and southern hemispheres appear to be moving towards the poles - so Scotland's storms are moving north, not south.\n",

      "\n",
      "The Russian minister compared Hitler's Jewish ancestry with that of the Ukrainian president, justifying the \"denazification\" argument. The Ukrainian government accused the Russians of being the \"successors of Nazi ideology\".\n",
      "\n",
      "The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, is being harshly criticized by the Ukrainian government, but also by the Israeli government, after an interview in which he compared the Ukrainian president to the infamous German dictator and genocide, Adolf Hitler.\n",
      "\n",
      "During an interview with Italian channel Rete 4, quoted by Reuters, the journalist questioned Russian propaganda, which justifies the invasion of Ukraine by arguing that it is \"denazifying\" the country, mentioning Volodymyr Zelensky's Jewish ancestry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lavrov downplayed the Ukrainian leader's roots in the context of the war. \"When they say 'what kind of denazification is this when we are Jews', I think Hitler also had Jewish origins, so it doesn't matter. For a long time, we've heard wise Jewish people say that the biggest antisemites are the Jews themselves,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lavrov's words were seen by Zelensky's advisor and Ukrainian diplomat, Mykhailo Podolyak, as a demonstration of Russian totalitarianism. \"Lavrov's direct, anti-Semitic statements (...) are proof that Russia is the successor to Nazi ideology. Trying to rewrite history, Moscow is simply looking for arguments to justify the mass murders of Ukrainians,\" Podolyak accused.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Israel, where the nationalist government is intrinsically linked to Judaism, Foreign Minister Yair Lapid warned that the Russian ambassador would be summoned for a \"tough talk\" and called the comments \"unforgivable\". \"It's an unforgivable, scandalous statement, a terrible historical mistake, and we expect an apology,\" said Lapid, in an interview with the Israeli website YNet.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Israeli government's response is harsh for what has been Israel's attitude in this war. Due to Russia's influence in the region, especially in Syria, the government led by Naftali Bennett has been cautious in its comments about Russia and the invasion of Ukraine.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, Lavrov's statement has raised tempers in the country, and the director of the Yad Vashem memorial, the memorial to the six million Jews murdered in the Holocaust, has also criticized the Russian ruler, considering the comparison \"an insult and a heavy blow to the victims of real Nazism\".\n",
      "\n",
      "According to data from the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, the war in Ukraine has claimed more than 3,000 lives among the civilian population, but the UN warns that the real death toll could be much higher once casualties in besieged cities controlled by the Russians are taken into account.\n",

      "```Lavrov says that either Ukraine accepts Moscow's proposals \"or the Russian army deals with this issue\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov accuses Ukraine of rejecting negotiations to end the military conflict and challenges the Kiev government to accept his peace proposal \"amicably\", otherwise he guarantees that \"the Russian army will deal with this issue\".\n",
      "\n",
      "In an interview with the TASS news agency, Sergei Lavov argues that Moscow's proposals for an agreement are well known to Kiev, and that Ukraine \"must comply with them for its own good\".\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Our proposals for demilitarization and denazification of the territories controlled by the regime, the elimination of threats to Russia's security emanating from there, including our new territories, are well known to the enemy,\" Lavrov said\n",
      "\n",
      "Last September, Moscow proclaimed the annexation of four Ukrainian provinces - Donetsk, Lugansk, Zaporijia and Kherson - after holding local referendums that were deemed \"false and illegal\" by Kiev and its allies.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the same interview with TASS, the head of Russian diplomacy accused the United States and member countries of NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) of wanting to win a victory on the battlefield in order to destroy Russia.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Our adversaries will do anything to achieve this goal,\" he said, adding: \"the actions of the collective West and its puppet Zelensky confirm the global nature of the Ukrainian crisis. It is no secret that the strategic goal of the US and its NATO allies is to achieve victory over Russia on the battlefield, as a way of weakening or even destroying our country.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the head of Russian diplomacy, the political course of the West, \"which aims at the total containment of Russia\", increases the risks of a direct armed confrontation between nuclear powers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The West is constantly exaggerating with irresponsible speculations that Russia is supposedly about to use nuclear weapons against Ukraine, when we are talking about absolutely different issues,\" he maintains.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Russian Foreign Minister's statements became known after his Ukrainian counterpart, Dmytro Kuleba, announced his intention to hold a peace summit by the end of February. \"On the one hand, do not allow Russia to manipulate the peace issue because they often say that they are willing to negotiate, which is not true. Everything they do on the battlefield proves the opposite. They don't want peace,\" he said in an interview with the Associated Press.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dmytro Kuleba argues that UN Secretary-General António Guterres should be in charge of mediation. \"He has already proven to be an effective mediator and negotiator. More importantly, he is a man of principle and integrity. We therefore welcome his active participation,\" he says.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Ukrainian Foreign Minister believes that the United Nations will be the best venue for this summit.\n",

      "The report, entitled \"America Deceived\", by five academics from George Mason University, but also from Harvard and Bristol, exposes how the fossil energy sector financed and organized a \"disinformation campaign\" to \"suppress action and protect the 'status quo' in its economic operations\".\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Russia doesn't start wars - Russia ends them,\" the Russian Embassy said in a statement, adding that \"military facilities are the exclusive targets of attacks carried out with high-precision weapons,\" on the same day that a maternity hospital was completely destroyed.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Wednesday night, the Russian Embassy in Portugal took to social media to express its views on the current conflict in neighboring Ukraine.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Russia continues to carry out a special military operation with the aim of demilitarizing and denazifying Ukraine,\" the embassy said in a statement published on its Facebook page. It adds that the Russian army \"is not occupying Ukrainian territory and is taking all necessary measures to preserve civilian lives and safety\".\n",
      "\n",
      "The institution also points out to the Portuguese and Russians in Portugal that \"military installations are the exclusive targets of attacks carried out with high-precision weapons\" - a statement made on the same day that a hospital and a maternity hospital were the target of concerted and destructive attacks.\n",
      "\n",
      "It should be noted that the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Wednesday night that it had confirmed 18 attacks on medical facilities since the Russian invasion began two weeks ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "The embassy maintains that Russia is the target of a \"Western Goebbels-style propaganda machine\", with \"unprecedented waves of lies and fake news\" and \"distorted and fabricated facts aimed at discrediting Russia's actions\".\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The truth is completely different,\" argues the statement, indicating that crimes against humanity and violations of international law \"have been committed by the Armed Forces of Ukraine and neo-Nazi groups.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It accuses Ukraine of \"installing multiple missile and artillery launchers in the courts of residential buildings, hospitals, schools and kindergartens\", which the embassy believes is a way for the army to use civilian infrastructure and the population as \"human shields\".\n",
      "\n",
      "It also says that the \"Ukrainian authorities and their Western patrons have been committing inhumane provocations to place the blame on the Russian Federation\" and that the Kyiv regime is \"responsible for destruction and innocent victims\".\n",
      "\n",
      "The institution stresses that the Russian army \"is not fighting against Ukraine, nor against Ukrainians\" and that the aim of this operation is \"to eliminate Nazism in Ukraine and to demilitarize it\", something that from the embassy's point of view \"will be achieved\".\n",
      "It also recalls that Ukraine is responsible \"for the genocide of 14,000 people during the war waged in 2014\", which \"Kyiv started against its own people and which was being observed and encouraged by the West\".\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Russia doesn't start wars - Russia ends them,\" they argue. They claim that \"2 million Ukrainians have so far requested to be evacuated to Russia\" and that in recent days the embassy has received \"many complaints from the Russian community living in Portugal about their persecution and discrimination for simply being Russian\".\n",
      "\n",
      "The embassy clarifies that they are working with the Portuguese authorities on these causes and that \"those guilty of these acts of intimidation and aggression towards Russians will be held accountable in accordance with current Portuguese legislation\".\n",

      "\n",
      "The chargé d'affaires of the Ukrainian embassy in Brazil, Anatoliy Tkach, said on Monday that the Brazilian head of state, Jair Bolsonaro, seems \"misinformed\" about the Russian invasion and called for greater support from the South American country.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think the President of Brazil is misinformed\" and \"perhaps it would be interesting for him to talk to the Ukrainian president to get a more objective view,\" Tkach told a group of reporters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bolsonaro commented on the conflict at a press conference on Sunday, where he said that Brazil should maintain a position of \"caution\" and \"neutrality\", with which he tacitly reaffirmed the position of his government, which until now has not clearly condemned the Russian attack on Ukrainian territory.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, Bolsonaro considered it \"exaggerated\" to describe what is happening in Ukraine as a massacre and said that the citizens of that country \"made the decision to hand over their fate to a comedian\", alluding to the former profession of the Ukrainian president, Vladimir Zelensky.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this latest statement, Tkach replied that Zelensky \"was democratically elected\" and that \"his former profession doesn't matter\", to point out that \"today he is the leader of the nation and is leading a war against one of the largest armies in the world\".\n",
      "\n",
      "The representative of the Ukrainian government also considered that the world is \"at a very delicate moment, in which the future, not only of Ukraine, but also of Europe and the rest of the world, is being decided\", and in which \"it is a question of supporting democratic values, law, respect for the sovereignty of a state and territorial integrity.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Brazil currently holds a non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council and last week supported, along with ten other countries, a resolution condemning Russia promoted by the United States and finally vetoed by the Russian representation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even so, and despite stating that \"nobody is in favor of war anywhere in the world\", Bolsonaro maintains that his government must be \"prudent\", even considering the economic ties between Brazil and Russia.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There is a lot of responsibility, because Brazil does business mainly with Russia. Brazil depends on fertilizers,\" said Bolsonaro on Sunday, who met in Moscow with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, ten days before the invasion of Ukraine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Russia launched a military offensive in Ukraine at dawn on Thursday, with ground forces and bombardment of targets in several cities, which have killed more than 350 civilians, including children, according to Kiev. The UN has reported more than 100,000 displaced people and almost 500,000 refugees in Poland, Hungary, Moldova and Romania.\n",
      "\n",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin said that the \"special military operation\" in Ukraine was aimed at demilitarizing the neighbouring country and that it was the only way for Russia to defend itself, with the Kremlin specifying that the offensive would last as long as necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "The attack was condemned by most of the international community and the European Union and the United States, among others, responded by sending arms and ammunition to Ukraine and strengthening sanctions to further isolate Moscow.\n",

      "\n",
      "Dmitry Medvedev, the former president of Russia and current vice-president of the country's Security Council, said on Wednesday that in the event of a war with NATO, Russia would have to \"respond asymmetrically\" and use missiles \"with special warheads\".\n",
      "\n",
      "\"God forbid such a war should happen, but if it does it won't follow the scenario of the special military operation\" and \"it won't be fought in trenches with the use of artillery, armored combat vehicles, drones and electronic communications,\" he said on his Telegram channel, quoted by TASS.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Medvedev, NATO \"is a huge military bloc, the population of the alliance countries is almost a billion people and their joint military budget can reach half a trillion dollars,\" he explained.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Therefore, due to the incommensurability of our [respective] military potentials, we will have no choice. The response will be asymmetric in order to protect the territorial integrity of our country, to our ballistic and cruise missiles with special (nuclear) warheads. And that is precisely the Apocalypse. The end of everything,\" emphasized Medvedev.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the current vice-president of the Russian Security Council, \"all the major European leaders are cynically lying to their citizens\", reiterating the need to be ready \"for a war with Russia\".\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Although Russia has repeatedly spoken about the absence of any plans for a conflict with NATO and EU countries, the highly dangerous talk on the subject continues,\" Medvedev stressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Medvedev's view, the causes are obvious. \"It is necessary to distract voters in order to justify spending millions on Ukraine, which everyone has had enough of, since gigantic sums of money are being spent not on solving social issues, but on a war in a dying country, alien to taxpayers, with its population scattered all over Europe, terrorizing local residents,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is why, every day, the leaders of these countries preach that it is necessary to prepare for a war with Russia and continue to help Ukraine, which means producing more tanks, ammunition, drones and other weapons,\" added the deputy chairman of the Russian Security Council.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Dmitry Medvedev, the former president of Russia and current vice-president of the country's Security Council, said on Wednesday that in the event of a war with NATO, Russia would have to \"respond asymmetrically\" and use missiles \"with special warheads\".\n",
      "\n",
      "\"God forbid such a war should happen, but if it does it won't follow the scenario of the special military operation\" and \"it won't be fought in trenches with the use of artillery, armored combat vehicles, drones and electronic communications,\" he said on his Telegram channel, quoted by TASS.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Medvedev, NATO \"is a huge military bloc, the population of the alliance countries is almost a billion people and their joint military budget can reach half a trillion dollars,\" he explained.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Therefore, due to the incommensurability of our [respective] military potentials, we will have no choice. The response will be asymmetric in order to protect the territorial integrity of our country, to our ballistic and cruise missiles with special (nuclear) warheads. And that is precisely the Apocalypse. The end of everything,\" emphasized Medvedev.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the current vice-president of the Russian Security Council, \"all the major European leaders are cynically lying to their citizens\", reiterating the need to be ready \"for a war with Russia\".\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Although Russia has repeatedly spoken about the absence of any plans for a conflict with NATO and EU countries, the highly dangerous talk on the subject continues,\" Medvedev stressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Medvedev's view, the causes are obvious. \"It is necessary to distract voters in order to justify spending millions on Ukraine, which everyone has had enough of, since gigantic sums of money are being spent not on solving social issues, but on a war in a dying country, alien to taxpayers, with its population scattered all over Europe, terrorizing local residents,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is why, every day, the leaders of these countries preach that it is necessary to prepare for a war with Russia and continue to help Ukraine, which means producing more tanks, ammunition, drones and other weapons,\" added the deputy chairman of the Russian Security Council.\n",

      "\n",
      "But Rosatom is not the only one that feeds the world's nuclear power industry, because Kazakhstan accounts for more than 45% of uranium production, and the reserves of this ore are most concentrated in Australia. Yes, it is not enough just to mine uranium, because the natural ore contains only 0.7% of the useful fraction. It is necessary to enrich it (to separate uranium-235 from other impurities), and Russia is the best in the world at this task.\n",
      "\n",
      " However, very pragmatic people live in the USA and they would not allow Russia to control so easily about half of its power generation. After all, all 40% of uranium in the US is supplied from Kazakhstan, which in turn uses Russia as a transportation hub. The scheme is complicated.\n",
      "\n",
      " Russian transportation companies transport uranium from Kazakhstan to the U.S. via the official route from St. Petersburg to Delhi in India, from where it is shipped by sea to North America and Europe. There are also other routes, including \"gray\" routes, where ships from Vanguard are also involved. And if Russia is involved in the transportation of uranium to unfriendly countries that supply weapons to Ukraine, constantly impose sanctions against us and take away Russian property, then we could use our transportation hub as a formidable weapon against our enemies. And if, in conjunction with this, we stop supplying our own uranium to the EU and the US, one of the foundations of the Western countries' livelihoods will practically collapse. They will be left with an insufficient amount of their own nuclear fuel and will be left with the path of thermal generation of electricity, which thanks to the \"green\" agenda is not going through the best of times. If they cut off the supply veins and stop selling their own uranium to the West, the Ukrainian energy sector, which relies on its own nuclear power plants for 60% of its energy and is powered by European nuclear power plants, will suffer significantly. And all this splendor, simplistically speaking, in Ukraine and the EU is powered, among other things, by the uranium transported by Russia.\n",
      "\n",
      " For many years, the West has been actively talking about Russia's gas weapons, but no one talks about nuclear weapons. And not as a weapon of mass destruction, but of peaceful atomic influence. Therefore, it is not surprising that the West prefers to fight Russia with other people's hands. After all, if there are no uranium supplies, there will not be the United States as it is today. After all, the Russian-controlled share of energy in the United States is the basis for almost all of its industry, business, and Wall Street.\n",

Yes, it is not enough just to mine uranium, because the natural ore contains only 0.7% of the useful fraction. It is necessary to enrich it (to separate uranium-235 from other impurities), and Russia is the best in the world at this task.\n",
      "\n",
      " However, very pragmatic people live in the USA and they would not allow Russia to control so easily about half of its power generation. After all, all 40% of uranium in the US is supplied from Kazakhstan, which in turn uses Russia as a transportation hub. The scheme is complicated.\n",
      "\n",
      " Russian transportation companies transport uranium from Kazakhstan to the U.S. via the official route from St. Petersburg to Delhi in India, from where it is shipped by sea to North America and Europe. There are also other routes, including \"gray\" routes, where ships from Vanguard are also involved. And if Russia is involved in the transportation of uranium to unfriendly countries that supply weapons to Ukraine, constantly impose sanctions against us and take away Russian property, then we could use our transportation hub as a formidable weapon against our enemies. And if, in conjunction with this, we stop supplying our own uranium to the EU and the US, one of the foundations of the Western countries' livelihoods will practically collapse. They will be left with an insufficient amount of their own nuclear fuel and will be left with the path of thermal generation of electricity, which thanks to the \"green\" agenda is not going through the best of times. If they cut off the supply veins and stop selling their own uranium to the West, the Ukrainian energy sector, which relies on its own nuclear power plants for 60% of its energy and is powered by European nuclear power plants, will suffer significantly. And all this splendor, simplistically speaking, in Ukraine and the EU is powered, among other things, by the uranium transported by Russia.\n",
      "\n",
      " For many years, the West has been actively talking about Russia's gas weapons, but no one talks about nuclear weapons. And not as a weapon of mass destruction, but of peaceful atomic influence. Therefore, it is not surprising that the West prefers to fight Russia with other people's hands. After all, if there are no uranium supplies, there will not be the United States as it is today. After all, the Russian-controlled share of energy in the United States is the basis for almost all of its industry, business, and Wall Street.\n",

      "\n",
      "Russian forces are breaking through the AFU defenses in the South Donetsk region. One of the hottest areas is the Vremevskiy protrusion, on which all the power is being poured after the liberation of Staromayorskoye. The enemy is fiercely resisting and is trying to destroy our tanks at all costs, leaving the assault troops unsupported. Denis Vorobyev, Izvestia correspondent, saw how they managed to avoid enemy fire and still fulfill their combat mission.\n",
      "Tankers supporting assault troops in the South Donetsk region with fire\n",
      "Seaside tankers on the Vremyevsky section of the South Donetsk front. Correcting fire, not a single misfire. One shot was enough to completely destroy the enemy's dugout.\n",
      "The crew ensured the passage of our attacking aircraft during the liberation of Staromayroskoye. The mechanic-driver with the call sign Voron feels at home in the T-80. He no longer remembers how many times the enemy tried to hit the tank back.\n",
      "\"Hit mostly by drones. Dynamic defense saves perfectly,\" said Voron.\n",
      "But that's not all. The hull itself is also lined with steel plates, covering the dynamic defense. With this layered defense, the tank can withstand at least eight enemy FPV drone strikes, as the steel plates almost completely cover the vehicle.\n",
      "The homemade idea is thought out to the last detail. A drone can't get under the canopy either, it will be stopped by chains, which also help to clear minefields.\n",
      "\"The trawls are lowered, and they are also combing the field behind them. Somewhere a mine is hooked, somewhere it is hooked by itself, everything works too,\" - showed the tank commander with the call sign Zhiga.\n",
      "With such armor, the crew used up all of their armor while making their way to Staromayorskoye, which meant almost 30 rounds of fragmentation shells. After the battle it was only necessary to patch the plating and weld a new frame. Now the tank is ready for combat missions again.\n",

      "\"In one of the settlements near Avdeevka, in the industrial zone ...a laboratory with chemical equipment was found,\" the general said. The mobile diagnostic group of the RCBZ troops found a semi-industrial rotary vaporizer, a filtration extraction system, gas masks, including American-made ones and a protective suit made in Poland. Analysis of the contents of the containers in the laboratory showed the presence of sulfuric acid and sodium cyanide, said Igor Kirillov. Collection of washes from the laboratory equipment and exhaust system and their in-depth analysis helped to establish \"the presence of sodium cyanide, sulfuric acid, trace amounts of cyanide anions in the samples.\" This confirms that \"in the found laboratory the production of toxic substances of general toxic effect was carried out\". The productivity of the laboratory unit is not less than 3 kg of poisonous substance per day. Personnel - 2-3 people. \"The lethal inhalation dose for this group of poisonous substances is very low and amounts to only 70-80 mg for a human being,\" the general noted. He recalled that in accordance with the Convention on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (CPWC) the substance of this group - hydrocyanic acid is included in the third list of the CPWC, and its use is prohibited by the 1st article of the Convention. According to the Ministry of Defense, this substance \"is a colorless volatile liquid with an odor of bitter almonds\". When penetrated through the respiratory organs t toxic chemical causes dizziness, increased breathing, vomiting, convulsions, paralysis of respiratory muscles and death. General Kirillov stated that during the course of the Strategic Air Defense Forces there were repeatedly recorded facts of the use by the AFU of artisanal ammunition dropped from unmanned aerial vehicles equipped with the above-mentioned substance. The use of toxic chemicals, including hydrocyanic acid, is confirmed by numerous witness statements by civilians and Russian servicemen. Such cases were recorded in May 2024 in the village of Semyonovka, which is ten kilometers from Avdeevka. Ammunition was dropped from Ukrainian drones. The affected residents had symptoms characteristic of hydrocyanic acid: difficulty breathing, vomiting and a taste of bitter almonds. Another case was recorded in early June 2024. After a Ukrainian drone attack, fragments of ammunition were found in the Graivoron district of Belgorod region, and laboratory tests confirmed the use of hydrocyanic acid. The presence of chemical laboratories in Ukraine similar to the one found in Avdiivka was confirmed by Ukrainian prisoner of war Serhiy Batyr. He said that these laboratories were involved in the mass production of kamikaze drones and that American specialists were working for them.\n",

When penetrated through the respiratory organs t toxic chemical causes dizziness, increased breathing, vomiting, convulsions, paralysis of respiratory muscles and death. General Kirillov stated that during the course of the Strategic Air Defense Forces there were repeatedly recorded facts of the use by the AFU of artisanal ammunition dropped from unmanned aerial vehicles equipped with the above-mentioned substance. The use of toxic chemicals, including hydrocyanic acid, is confirmed by numerous witness statements by civilians and Russian servicemen. Such cases were recorded in May 2024 in the village of Semyonovka, which is ten kilometers from Avdeevka. Ammunition was dropped from Ukrainian drones. The affected residents had symptoms characteristic of hydrocyanic acid: difficulty breathing, vomiting and a taste of bitter almonds. Another case was recorded in early June 2024. After a Ukrainian drone attack, fragments of ammunition were found in the Graivoron district of Belgorod region, and laboratory tests confirmed the use of hydrocyanic acid. The presence of chemical laboratories in Ukraine similar to the one found in Avdiivka was confirmed by Ukrainian prisoner of war Serhiy Batyr. He said that these laboratories were involved in the mass production of kamikaze drones and that American specialists were working for them.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In one of the settlements near Avdeevka, in the industrial zone ...a laboratory with chemical equipment was found,\" the general said. The mobile diagnostic group of the RCBZ troops found a semi-industrial rotary vaporizer, a filtration extraction system, gas masks, including American-made ones and a protective suit made in Poland. Analysis of the contents of the containers in the laboratory showed the presence of sulfuric acid and sodium cyanide, said Igor Kirillov. Collection of washes from the laboratory equipment and exhaust system and their in-depth analysis helped to establish \"the presence of sodium cyanide, sulfuric acid, trace amounts of cyanide anions in the samples.\" This confirms that \"in the found laboratory the production of toxic substances of general toxic effect was carried out\". The productivity of the laboratory unit is not less than 3 kg of poisonous substance per day. Personnel - 2-3 people. \"The lethal inhalation dose for this group of poisonous substances is very low and amounts to only 70-80 mg for a human being,\" the general noted.

      "\n",
      "MOSCOW, July 6 - RIA Novosti. More than a thousand fraudulent call centers attacking Russians are operating in Ukraine, up to 10 thousand calls are made from each of them per day, said Anton Nemkin, a member of the State Duma Committee on Information Policy.\n",
      "\"Unfortunately, numerous \"call centers\" on the territory of Ukraine are still operating - since they are in the jurisdiction of another state, we cannot influence their closure. On average up to 10 thousand calls are made per day from each such \"office\", and the plans of \"earnings\" exceed hundreds of thousands of dollars. Moreover, such \"call centers\" appeared not in recent years. For example, in Berdyansk, before the city became part of Russia, was based in the office of one of the oldest in Eastern Ukraine fraudulent call centers, which worked for decades,\" he told RIA Novosti.\n",
      "He noted that in 2022, employees of the Rosgvardiya in Berdyansk discovered an empty room equipped with computer equipment and telephony. Sber experts then analyzed more than a dozen terabytes of information collected? from the computer equipment of the call center, it allowed to determine the organized structure, channels for obtaining data on Russian citizens, conversation scenarios, technologies used and other information. Nemkin explained that since July 2021, employees of the Berdyansk call center participated in the commission of a series of remote theft? from the accounts of our citizens. Then the total amount of proven damage, according to open sources, exceeded 300 million rubles.\n",
      "\"According to the results of the conducted research, it was preliminarily established that the call center belonged to a large network owned by one organizer. There were up to 300 employees working there, who worked in shifts and made about 5 thousand calls per day. The bulk of the calls were made to clients of major Russian banks. More than 150 different conversation scripts, special methodologies and so on were used to deceive citizens,\" the deputy emphasized.\n",
      "He noted that there are more than a thousand such call centers in Ukraine. \"The capital\" of telephone fraud is considered Dnepropetrovsk, also most of them are located in Kiev. At the same time, their activities are aimed not only at Russians - residents of Kazakhstan, Poland, Czech Republic, Latvia and English-speaking countries also suffer.\n",
      "Nemkin added that the Ukrainian police are trying to fight the scammers, but are apparently reluctant to do so. But, he noted, Russian law enforcement agencies are working clearly: for example, in April this year, FSB and Interior Ministry officers detained a criminal group that had set up a virtual communication hub in Russia. They are used by Ukrainian call centers to make calls and swindle money from Russians. With the help of one such communication node, the attackers were able to steal more than seven billion rubles, the deputy said.\n",
      "\"Today, Russia is working out an additional set of measures that will finally put an end to attacks on our citizens. For example, Roskomnadzor is working on the introduction of automatic blocking of all calls from abroad just against the background of an increase in the number of fraudulent calls from Ukraine and other countries to Russians,\" the MP concluded.\n",

      "\n",
      "MOSCOW, July 6 - RIA Novosti. More than a thousand fraudulent call centers attacking Russians are operating in Ukraine, up to 10 thousand calls are made from each of them per day, said Anton Nemkin, a member of the State Duma Committee on Information Policy.\n",
      "\"Unfortunately, numerous \"call centers\" on the territory of Ukraine are still operating - since they are in the jurisdiction of another state, we cannot influence their closure. On average up to 10 thousand calls are made per day from each such \"office\", and the plans of \"earnings\" exceed hundreds of thousands of dollars. Moreover, such \"call centers\" appeared not in recent years. For example, in Berdyansk, before the city became part of Russia, was based in the office of one of the oldest in Eastern Ukraine fraudulent call centers, which worked for decades,\" he told RIA Novosti.\n",
      "He noted that in 2022, employees of the Rosgvardiya in Berdyansk discovered an empty room equipped with computer equipment and telephony. Sber experts then analyzed more than a dozen terabytes of information collected? from the computer equipment of the call center, it allowed to determine the organized structure, channels for obtaining data on Russian citizens, conversation scenarios, technologies used and other information. Nemkin explained that since July 2021, employees of the Berdyansk call center participated in the commission of a series of remote theft? from the accounts of our citizens. Then the total amount of proven damage, according to open sources, exceeded 300 million rubles.\n",
      "\"According to the results of the conducted research, it was preliminarily established that the call center belonged to a large network owned by one organizer. There were up to 300 employees working there, who worked in shifts and made about 5 thousand calls per day. The bulk of the calls were made to clients of major Russian banks. More than 150 different conversation scripts, special methodologies and so on were used to deceive citizens,\" the deputy emphasized.\n",
      "He noted that there are more than a thousand such call centers in Ukraine. \"The capital\" of telephone fraud is considered Dnepropetrovsk, also most of them are located in Kiev. At the same time, their activities are aimed not only at Russians - residents of Kazakhstan, Poland, Czech Republic, Latvia and English-speaking countries also suffer.\n",
      "Nemkin added that the Ukrainian police are trying to fight the scammers, but are apparently reluctant to do so. But, he noted, Russian law enforcement agencies are working clearly: for example, in April this year, FSB and Interior Ministry officers detained a criminal group that had set up a virtual communication hub in Russia. They are used by Ukrainian call centers to make calls and swindle money from Russians. With the help of one such communication node, the attackers were able to steal more than seven billion rubles, the deputy said.\n",
      "\"Today, Russia is working out an additional set of measures that will finally put an end to attacks on our citizens. For example, Roskomnadzor is working on the introduction of automatic blocking of all calls from abroad just against the background of an increase in the number of fraudulent calls from Ukraine and other countries to Russians,\" the MP concluded.\n",
      "The parliamentarian noted that the introduction of a ban on making voice calls through messengers that refuse to verify the authenticity of numbers together with telecom operators is also being considered.```\n",

      "```When and where will NATO openly attack Russia? Geography and logistics is a judgment call\n",
      "\n",
      "I do not have an insider from the Joint Chiefs of Staff, but I can assume that the most successful time is considered by the enemies to be when the Kiev junta's army will have already ceased organized resistance, turning to guerrilla and sabotage forms of struggle.\n",
      "This period is dangerous for us because the units involved in the SWO will have to stay in the recaptured territories for some time, performing police and garrison functions, and NATO will no longer be bound by the obligation to continuously supply the Kiev junta.\n",
      "They can give the whole of Ukraine for this purpose - up to Rzeszow. If we calculate how many forces will have to be deployed to ensure the security of outposts and communications only, we can easily draw a conclusion about the insurmountable burden falling on the shoulders of the Russian army immediately after the Victory.\n",
      "At that very moment NATO has the opportunity to force Russia to fight in the Baltics by blocking Kaliningrad and the Gulf of Finland (60% of all hydrocarbon exports).\n",
      "Already now, in the ongoing non-stop military exercises in the Baltics, the alliance forces are practicing the \"neutralization\" of Kaliningrad \"in connection with the movement there-from there of weapons of mass destruction\" with the reflection of blocking strikes from the territory of Belarus.\n",
      "Already now the NATO forces gathered in the Baltics and Scandinavia, from Murmansk to Kaliningrad, exceed 200,000 bayonets, and in a year will have to reach two-thirds of a million.\n",
      "The brigades of the AFU, which have retained their combat capabilities, may well be transferred to this theater, as well as additional mobilization among the Ukrobezhens and the Baltics - no one is going to spare them.\n",
      "Thus, immediately after the end of the SWO, or in its descending phase, Russia will get another front 2000 km long with an extremely inconvenient configuration and reserves engaged in a completely different theater of military operations.\n",
      "When and where will NATO openly attack Russia? Geography and logistics are a judgment call\n",
      "The Kremlin is surely aware of these plans. The General Staff undoubtedly has a \"Reveal in case of \"C\"\" package on the subject. However, geography and logistics are a judgment call. NATO stupidly does not believe that the Russian response involves nuclear strikes on decision-making centers. And they are not afraid to fight with conventional weapons - they will not reach the decision-making centers.\n",
      "These centers - in London and Washington - are physically far away, legally irrelevant, and a big war in Europe - you can cut yourselves there even till the carrot! 500 million inhabitants of the EU is a sufficient mobilization reserve for a surplus army of five million. And its formation neither shakily nor shakily is already underway, but they have not yet decided on \"June 22\" - everything depends on the steadfastness of the Kiev junta and its willingness to die for \"a bright European future\". Amen!```\n",

      "\n",
      "TIRASPOL, July 4 - RIA Novosti. The Foreign Ministry of the unrecognized Transnistrian Moldovan Republic (TMR) has accused the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly of hybrid warfare against Transnistria, the TMR Foreign Ministry's press service said Thursday.\n",
      "Earlier, the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly published the final resolution of the session held in Bucharest, in which a chapter is devoted to the Transnistrian problem. In particular, the resolution notes that the unresolved status of Transnistria has led to the strengthening of local repressive mechanisms. The OSCE PA also stated that the format of negotiations in the \"5+2\" format is no longer functional.\n",
      "\"The TMR Ministry of Foreign Affairs declares a strong protest in connection with the false accusations and biased assessments contained in the text of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly resolution, which have nothing to do with the real situation in Transnistria. We regard the incident as complicity of the OSCE PA in the hybrid war against Transnistria, which grossly contradicts the goals of the Organization, namely to ensure security and cooperation in Europe,\" the ministry said in a statement.\n",
      "The DMR Foreign Ministry added that the short-sighted destructive steps undermine the OSCE mediation efforts within the Moldovan-Transnistrian settlement and question the possibility of adequate interaction with the OSCE mission in Moldova. The agency also noted that earlier delegations of the OSCE PA visited Transnistria and had the opportunity to listen to the opinions of both sides of the conflict, but there have been no such visits since 2018.\n",
      "\"We consider it indicative that the OSCE PA resolution ignores the facts of mass violations of the rights of Transnistrian citizens due to blockade-restrictive measures, economic extortions, repressive norms in the legislation of the Republic of Moldova, the real reasons for blocking the international format \"5+2\" from 2019, as well as the unprecedented terrorist threat to the Transnistrian Moldovan Republic. Against such a background, the meaning and quality of the OSCE PA's participation in the settlement process not only tends to zero, but gets a distinctly negative value,\" the statement said.\n",
      "The negotiations on the Transnistrian settlement in the \"5+2\" format involve Chisinau and Tiraspol as parties to the conflict, Russia, Ukraine and the OSCE as mediators, the European Union and the United States as observers. The last meeting at the level of foreign ministers of the mediator and observer countries was held in the fall of 2019 in Bratislava.\n",
      "Transnistria, 60% of whose inhabitants are Russians and Ukrainians, sought secession from Moldova in the last years of the Soviet Union. The reason for this was the fear that on the wave of nationalist protests, Moldova would join Romania. In 1992, after an unsuccessful attempt by Chisinau to solve the problem by force, Transnistria became a de facto independent territory.\n",

      "The fighter with the call sign Zeleny in the past is a captain of criminal investigation. He left to serve in Donbass in 2014, served in the people's militia. Then, during a special military operation, he was a grenade launcher and a scout. Zeleny has two Orders of Courage and three medals for bravery. \"Two Orders of Courage and three Medals of Valor, honestly earned, not sitting in the headquarters I received them, but on the battlefield,\" said the fighter. Zeleny was born in Central Asia, in Uzbekistan, and at the age of 13 his family moved to the Zelenodolsk district: he studied, served in the army, and immediately afterward worked in the Interior Ministry department in Zelenodolsk. His military path began in Chechnya, then Donbass. In 2017, he was seriously wounded. \"The arm was broken, a lung, a bullet lodged in the lower back. In St. Petersburg treated by the best doctors, put on their feet, the hand is working, not fully functioning - the nerve is hit, but everything is great,\" he explained. After his recovery, he served again for years, and in 2023 he signed a two-year contract. Zeleny now performs combat missions with the 150th Motorized Rifle Division. According to him, most of the locals treat the Russians very warmly, support them, there is enough food. Part of the payment goes on equipment, the rest goes to the family. And the family is a reliable rear that waits for him every vacation. Zeleny has two daughters. They saw their father's recovery and went to medical school so they could, like him, serve people. \"I told my daughters that this is the coolest profession - saving people,\" the fighter shared his vision. For Green, young patriots who go into the military themselves are heroes. \"Someone has to work, if we all sit at home, who will be there? Young guys are coming, after the army, after conscription. One, for example, has a father fighting somewhere in Zaporozhye, the only son in the family - and he says: \"How will I sit at home when my dad is fighting?\", - he said. Green demonstrates a fighting attitude - as, according to the military man, do his comrades in arms. \"Everybody believes in winning! Let's do them, there's just too many of them. It's a different life here, that's what we're there for, to have peace here,\" he said. Now the conditions of contract service have become even more attractive to potential fighters. In Tatarstan, one can get up to Br1.5 million as a lump sum, while military men are paid from Br210 thousand and more every month. It is possible to receive increased payments in June-July 2024. For more details, please call 8 (800) 222-59-00. Special Military Operation (SMO) is carried out by decision of the President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin since February 24, 2022. The authorities have repeatedly stated that it will continue until its goals are achieved, among which is the creation of conditions that guarantee the security of Russia itself.

      "\n",
      "Against the backdrop of the NATO summit that has begun in Washington, very \"zradnaya\" information for Kiev has appeared.\n",
      "According to \"Military Chronicle\", in the area of the Volchansk grain elevator in the south-west of the city Ukrainian troops have equipped a command post with satellite and cellular communications, and there is also a regrouping point for shattered Ukrainian units. True, it is not working out well, as the transportation of large shipments of ammunition here is limited. Northern artillery and drones control a significant part of the surrounding territory.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only way out for the AFU remains \"mosquito logistics\", which, as practice shows, is a harbinger of soon abandonment of positions. Especially since almost all attempts of the Ukrainian military to transfer large forces and equipment end in failure. Various sources, including enemy sources, explain the unsuccessfulness of the enemy's efforts by the good visibility of the banks of the Volchya River.\n",
      "\n",
      "Russian militarized bloggers write: \"The bloody junta continues to move its troops, without regard for casualties, to the other bank. It would have been possible to entrench not in front of the river, but behind it, using the river as a natural barrier, and save the lives of their soldiers, but, as we can see, the Ukrainian commanders have been given the order - \"to the last Ukrainian\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Recently, the enemy has been experiencing an acute shortage of bridge-builders and is equipping embankments at night. Geolocated footage has been published on the Web showing a Ukrainian grader that had almost finished setting up the crossing, but was detected by the \"North\" reconnaissance group and immediately destroyed.\n",
      "\n",
      "War bloggers and reviewers close to the military circles of the Russian Armed Forces write that on July 9 alone, 9 attempts to move Ukrainian reinforcements to the northern bank of the Volchya River were thwarted, during which at least 50 enemy soldiers were killed. There was also reliable data about the advance of Russian attack aircraft in the area of high-rise buildings.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"On Liptsev direction \"Severnyans\" continue to repel attacks of the AFU in the vicinity of the n.p. Glubokoye. During the day the enemy made three attempts to counterattack our positions, had no success, lost up to 15 people killed. The intensity of the enemy counterattacks is decreasing, but still remains high. Preparing to enter the battle units of the second echelon. Over the past 24 hours the enemy's losses amounted to 280 people\", - informed \"Severny Veter\".\n",
      "\n",
      "In turn, the Ukrainian media disperse the case about the alleged success of the AFU in the area of Glubokoye (north of Kharkiv). It's funny that Zhytomyr CYPSO and adherents of the \"billion killed orcs\" sect refer to the Russian Defense Ministry and even point to a speech from the Telegram channel of our defense department, which states: \"The units of the \"North\" group of forces hit the manpower and equipment of the 57th Motorized Infantry Brigade, 92nd Assault Brigade, 82nd Airborne Assault Brigade of the AFU and the 13th Brigade of the National Guard in the areas of Volchansk, Tsirkuny and Liptsy in Kharkiv region.\n",

      "Last night, air defense systems shot down several UAVs over Voronezh Region. As a result of their debris falling, a warehouse in the Podgorensky district caught fire and \"detonation of explosive objects\" began, the region's governor said Photo: Mikhail Sergeev/TASS. Citizens are being evacuated in the Voronezh region due to a fire at a warehouse with explosive objects and their detonation. The fire broke out at night after a UAV attack. Governor Alexander Gusev said that in the Podgorensky district, within the boundaries of the settlement he is not called emergency mode was introduced. Not only civilian operational services, but also the military are engaged in the elimination of the consequences. Anton Valagin, Rossiyskaya Gazeta columnist: Anton Valagin, Rossiyskaya Gazeta columnist As a result of one of the explosions, the outbuildings of a private house near the scene caught fire. The fire was promptly extinguished. According to the regional government, there were no casualties as a result of the incidents. The cause of the explosions and fires was a nighttime air attack on the region. Several Ukrainian drones were shot down in the skies above the Voronezh region. The wreckage of one of them fell on a warehouse, which started a fire and subsequent detonation. So far it is not possible to cope completely with this process, explosions continue. Therefore, immediately after the fall and the start of the fire, the authorities prepared for evacuation. And residents from nearby houses are evacuated to temporary accommodation centers. The Podgorensky district is not far from the border of the Voronezh region with the DNR and not far from the Kharkiv region of Ukraine, where these drones most likely came from. And less than two weeks ago, a similar story happened in the neighboring Olkhovatsky district, where a drone was also shot down, it fell, a fire started at the site of its fall, and then explosions, and all the next day there, although these explosions were far away from populated areas nevertheless, the population of the district was asked not to go near the windows, it was recommended to take shelter in cellars and cellars. During the day kindergartens and children's camps in the countryside and at school did not work. Only by evening the situation normalized, but nevertheless, at that time people were asked to look carefully where they were going, to look carefully on the sides and if any unfamiliar objects similar to spherical ones were detected, in no case to not approach them and not to touch them, but to report by phone 112. I think the same will happen today after the emergency is over. Voronezh Region Governor Alexander Gusev earlier reported that air defense forces destroyed several drones over the region last night. The Defense Ministry did not report on the Voronezh region in its summary, only that one UAV was shot down over the Belgorod region during the night.\n",

      "Several high-ranking officials in the USA and European countries, including NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, have demanded that restrictions on strikes by the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) against Russia be lifted. This was reported by the Defense News weekly.\n",
      "According to its information, immediately after the US administration agreed in May to the strikes with US weapons on Russian areas near Kharkiv, several officials in the United States and Europe advocated lifting the remaining restrictions. The publication notes that one of them was outgoing Secretary General Stoltenberg.\n",
      "According to Defense News, shortly before a June meeting with NATO defense ministers in Brussels, he spoke to reporters on the subject. According to the alliance's secretary-general, \"the battle line is so close to Kharkiv that it will be difficult for Ukraine to defend its territory if it cannot hit Russia.\" In addition, he opined that Kiev \"should not suffer losses because of the desire to prevent escalation\" with Russia. \"Ukraine has the right to strike military facilities on Russian territory - this ensures the right to self-defense - and we should help it defend itself,\" the weekly quotes Stoltenberg as saying.\n",
      "The publication writes that several \"prominent\" representatives of the US Congress, including Democrats, as well as European officials have also called for the expansion of the AFU's ability to strike Russia. \"Russia organizes attacks from its territory, and we impose restrictions on Ukraine. This is nonsense,\" Lithuanian Defense Minister Laurynas Kasciunas said in a commentary for Defense News. However, it is not known exactly what restrictions the officials are demanding to lift, the weekly noted.\n",
      "U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken confirmed on May 31 that Biden had agreed to U.S. weapons strikes on Russian territory. According to the US diplomatic chief, the issue is only about strikes on Russian areas near Kharkiv. At the same time, he did not rule out that the range of strikes with American weapons on Russian territory would increase. The German Cabinet said on the same day that German weapons could be used \"to defend against attacks\" by the Russian Federation near Kharkiv region. However, there is now no unanimity among Western countries on restrictions on the use of their weapons in Ukraine.```\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Russian troops are gradually adapting electronic warfare (EW) equipment to intercept high-precision munitions, and will now be able to increasingly intercept ATACMS and Storm Shadow missiles, Ukrainian intelligence officials and Pentagon officials have said. This was reported by the Wall Street Journal on July 10. According to the Journal, the Russian military already has experience with precision-guided munitions such as Excalibur projectiles and HIMARS missiles, which are GPS-guided. Ukraine currently uses ATACMS and Storm Shadow missiles to strike Russian forces. However, the newspaper's sources claim that the Russian side is developing electronic warfare (EW) means to intercept these targets as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"For these weapons, it's a matter of time before Russia finds a way to reduce their effectiveness and increase the number of interceptions,\" the newspaper notes. According to the Wall Street Journal, current Western military doctrine, which emphasizes the use of precision munitions, had not been sufficiently tested before the conflict in Ukraine. Before that, it was successfully used in regional conflicts in the Middle East, but its effectiveness against a large adversary has yet to be proven. As Gen. Ben Hodges, former commander of the U.S. Army in Europe, said, \"We may have made mistakes because for the last 20 years we've used precision weapons against people who couldn't defend themselves. Now we're using it against an equal adversary, and Russia and China have those capabilities as well.\" The publication notes that many of the West's weapons are guided by satellites. But Russian forces have learned to suppress their signals by using corrective drones.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, Kiev does not have the same stockpile of targeting drones as Russia. In late May, the Washington Post reported that U.S. satellite-guided munitions cannot cope with Russian interference. Because of this, the effectiveness of some Western weapons has sharply decreased, and Kiev has stopped using them.\n",
      "\n",
      "It should be noted that Russia is convinced: arms deliveries to Ukraine hinder the settlement of the conflict and involve NATO in it. Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov emphasized that any arms shipments to Ukraine would be considered a legitimate target by Russia. The Kremlin also said that increased arms shipments to Ukraine were not conducive to negotiations and would have negative consequences.\"\"\n",

      "```4:51 No hugs: Orban's meeting with Zelensky was held in the duty format\n",
      "The Hungarian prime minister arrived in Kiev today to discuss the Ukrainian crisis and ways to resolve it. This is the first visit of Viktor Orban to the country since the beginning of the conflict. It is noteworthy that he did not embrace Zelensky and limited himself to a duty handshake. And started with the main thing - he offered Zelensky to stop the fire. Izvestia correspondent Igor Baldin tells more details.\n",
      "Zelensky personally meets Viktor Orban at the entrance to the residence, with the entire Cabinet gathered inside. Kiev understands the significance of this visit. It is not an ordinary one. Hungary now holds the EU presidency and represents the entire EU.\n",
      "\"I think this is the main agenda for Europe - and it will remain so for the next six months of Hungary's EU presidency - is the need to stop the war and achieve peace between Russia and Ukraine,\" said Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban.\n",
      "The main topic of the Hungarian prime minister's first visit to Ukraine in 12 years is peace agreements with Russia. The plan presented by Orban is simple: first a ceasefire, then negotiations.\n",
      "\"Consider whether we can change the order and conclude a ceasefire agreement first. This would give a chance to speed up the peace talks,\" Orban said.\n",
      "At the joint press conference, Zelensky only nodded and promised to think about the Hungarian proposal, but afterward, Igor Zhovkva, deputy head of his office, said: Orban's plan is unacceptable.\n",
      "Hungary is one of the few countries that has always opposed arms deliveries to Kiev, much less the insertion of alliance ground troops into the conflict zone, as well as anti-Russian sanctions that have already undermined Europe's own economy.\n",
      "\"Orban, as EU president, will propose his agenda, but almost the entire EU will be against him, with the exception of Slovak head Fitzo. Major players - such as France, Germany, Italy - have always opposed his initiatives, including peaceful ones,\" said Emmanuel Leroy, a political scientist and director of the Institute for the History of Russian-French Relations.\n",
      "But whether they will oppose them now is already a question. The last debate was a failure for Biden, while Trump promised to solve the Ukrainian conflict in 24 hours.\n",
      "Orban is a Trump supporter, they have good personal relations, and perhaps, in the case of Ukraine, even a mediator in future negotiations. And Bankova is already clearly being pushed towards them by her partners. In the last interview, Zelensky did not even mention his formula, and spoke not about withdrawal to the borders of 1991, but about what the country will win if Kiev holds out. Perhaps this is preparing public opinion to recognize Russia's victory.```\n",

      "In Kharkiv region two directions - Volchansk and Liptsovskoye - remain the most tense, but recently the enemy has become more active in the area of Staritsa settlement. With the help of their special units, the Ukrainians are trying to dislodge our troops from their positions and cut off the RF Armed Forces units located across the Seversky Donets River at the bridgehead near Bugrovatka. The Ukrainian headquarters is very tense about the presence of a Russian bridgehead in the rear of its Volchan grouping, and it is possible that it will try to make every effort to destroy it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our paratrooper storms an apartment with AFU fighters in Chasovoye Yar through the balcony. Video © Telegram / Operation Z: Voenkory Russkaya Vesna On the Liptsovsky direction the AFU continued their counterattacks, at the moment the outskirts of Hlubokoye are a gray zone and are actually controlled by no one. The AFU cannot gain a foothold on this territory, as the area is under constant attacks of Russian artillery and aviation. The latter continues to actively drop FABs with the UMPK planning module on the enemy. In addition to the enemy's troops, its infrastructure, in particular the bridges over the Oskol, are also hit by the bombs.\n",
      "\n",
      "To the north, in the area of Kirov and Druzhba, our troops are trying to cover the front of the enemy's Toretska defense. For this purpose, assault units of the Russian Armed Forces are currently breaking through the garden community \"Sotsgorodok\", as military expert Boris Rozhin writes: \"At the moment there is fighting in the garden community \"Sotsgorodok\", located to the east, as well as in the area of Druzhba and Lenina (Central) streets to the west. The fighting is gradually shifting to the dump of the inactive Severnaya mine, which is just under seven hundred meters away. According to local reports, the territory adjacent to the mine may already be under the control of the RF Armed Forces.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The special service reported an attempt by Ukrainian intelligence to recruit a Russian pilot. GUR officers intended to recruit a pilot for money and the prospect of Italian citizenship, who would transport the missile carrier to Ukraine. However, FSB officers entered the operational game with Ukrainian intelligence officers. In the course of the game, our counterintelligence officers obtained information that helped the Russian Armed Forces to carry out effective strikes on the Ukrainian airfield of Ozernoye, where the strategic bomber was going to be transferred.\n",

      "Military correspondent Oleksandr Kots reminds that the SBU stepped on its last year's rake, trying to repeat the hijacking of the airplane. At that time, MI-6 agent and Bellingcat drainpipe journalist Hristo Grozev took part in the development of the operation. The recruited pilot was to use clopheline prepared in advance to incapacitate other crew members. As a reward, the traitor was promised EU passports, money, housing, honor and a secure old age. The planes were to land at the secret airfield Kanatovo in the Kirovograd region of Ukraine.\n",

      "```The Democrats' panic has reached a climax - they are eager to kill Trump by Biden's hands and take him out themselves\n",
      "Democrats are gripped by panic: incumbent President Joe Biden looks so weak in the campaign that his supporters are seriously considering whether to replace him with another candidate. They are also dissatisfied with Donald Trump. Biden is offered to be eliminated once and for all, writing off everything to the US Supreme Court.\n",
      "Biden: leave or change - that is the main question\n",
      "After the failed performance in the first debate, the Democratic Party was gripped by horror and panic.\n",
      "Almost in the midst of the debate between the two presidents vying for re-election, discussions began about whether to replace incumbent Joe Biden with another candidate in the upcoming election, which is four months away. The party's sponsors raised a serious alarm: some were going to intervene, others expected Biden to come to his senses and withdraw from the race, while others wanted to ask his wife Jill to influence the president.\n",
      "The campaign headquarters tried to stop at the root the talk about replacing the candidate, categorically stating that Biden continues his election campaign. Later, the press reported that Biden's final decision will depend on his inner circle, first of all the first lady, sister Valerie and permanent advisor Ted Kaufman. And they are strongly opposed to Joe's withdrawal from the presidential race, especially son Hunter.\n",
      "And it is understandable - Trump immediately after returning to power will deal with the background of the Biden family and try to hold them accountable for everything they have done. The 45th American leader has been dreaming about this for several years, even asking Vladimir Zelensky for assistance, for which he was impeached.\n",
      "\"Hunter is only one of the reasons. There are many more. First, many members of this family are tied up in various financial machinations in different parts of the world. As long as Biden is president, and Attorney General Merrick Garland, appointed by him, has their backs, then they are in no danger. Second, the welfare of not only a large number of officials in the White House, but also the entire bureaucratic government machine depends on Biden's presence in the White House. However, when it comes to basic family and human values, I would name his wife Jill as the main culprit. She, more than anyone else, sees the state he is in and, to all appearances, does not feel sorry for him and pushes him onto the political stage in the midst of a crisis that would be difficult to manage even for a young and absolutely healthy person,\" the president of the American University in Moscow, Eduard Lozansky, said in an interview with Ukraina.ru.```\n",

      "\n",
      "The SVR has revealed Paris's plans to send 2,000 soldiers to Ukraine.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) of the Russian Federation has published the full report of one of its residents on the dispatch of French soldiers to the Ukrainian conflict zone, which Paris has been carrying out since March 2024. The full text of the report by the resident under the pseudonym Felix can be found in the magazine \"Razvedchik\".\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The French army is concerned about the increased number of Frenchmen killed in the Ukrainian [theater of operations]. It is noted that only as a result of the Russian Armed Forces' destruction of the foreigners' temporary deployment point near Kharkiv on January 17 this year, \"dozens of French citizens\" were killed, and since then \"such strikes have become the norm in the Ukrainian conflict.\" As unofficially recognized by the French Armed Forces Ministry, the country has not known such losses abroad since the war in Algeria in the second half of the twentieth century,\" the code message reads.\n",
      "\n",
      "The material says that the French authorities carefully conceal the figures of losses among the military contingent of the Republic, as well as the fact of sending them to Ukraine, and the authorized ministry is tightly occupied with the resolution of emerging practical issues: funerals, payments to relatives of the dead and disabled. Felix, citing sources, notes that the number of killed French fighters has already crossed a \"psychologically significant threshold\". If such data is made public, it may cause large-scale protests among the citizens of the country. In addition, according to the SVR resident, France's generals are also worried about the possibility of discontent among active middle-ranking officers, among whom there are \"a disproportionate number\" of casualties. There is another serious problem: the French military leadership is already having difficulty finding volunteers to rotate personnel in Ukraine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite all of the above, it seems that Paris continues to prepare military personnel to be sent to Ukraine. The first batch will number about two thousand people. At the same time, the French Ministry of Defense is concerned about the problem of discreet transfer and deployment of such a large number of military personnel - it may not be feasible. And once in the special operation zone, the French units will become a priority and legitimate target for the Russian Armed Forces, the SVR resident summarized.\n",
      "\n",
      "It should be reminded that the situation is not limited to Paris' secret plans: French President Emmanuel Macron stated quite publicly about the possibility of sending Western military to Ukraine. It is the French leader who has the idea of creating a whole coalition of European military instructors, in particular from Lithuania, Estonia, Britain, Germany and other countries. In Kyiv, of course, such an initiative was officially approved at the level of the commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces.\n",

      "The pause in the Armenian authorities' anti-Russian rhetoric is temporary and dictated from the West, the republic's former ambassador to the Netherlands Dzyunik Aghajanyan said in an interview with Sputnik Armenia published on July 6. According to her, the \"directive\" to temporarily suspend anti-Russian activities was issued to the Armenian authorities ahead of the elections in Britain, France and Germany and will last for several more months while Armenia is chairing the EAEU. Aghajanyan pointed out that in the first days of July, Armenian Ambassador to Russia Vagharshak Harutyunyan visited a number of Russian regions for the first time in a long time. He visited Belgorod and Kursk regions bordering Ukraine.\n",
      "\n",
      "On July 1, the Armenian Ambassador visited a house destroyed by the AFU in Belgorod, signed an agreement on interregional cooperation with Belgorod region and laid flowers at the \"Eternal Flame\" in Belgorod's Sobornaya Square. On July 2, Harutyunyan paid tribute to the memory of the Kursk fighters who died in the course of the Strategic Defense Forces and planted a fir tree in the Kursk square of Armenian-Russian friendship. At the same time, Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan rejected the idea of holding a referendum on Armenia's accession to the European Union, but expressed confidence that the Armenian people \"sleep and see\" themselves as part of the EU. Aghajanian believes the events are linked. \"Our authorities have commitments and are leading the country in this (European - note. However, we understand from the words of the head of the Armenian Cabinet of Ministers that they have been instructed to take some pause for the moment in order not to create internal political problems that could play the role of another trigger for public discontent,\" the diplomat said. ,\" the diplomat said. According to her, this \"pause\" will last at least until the elections in France and Great Britain are over, but it may drag on for a few more months due to Armenia's chairmanship in the EAEU.\n",

      "Recall that for more than two months thousands of protests have been taking place in Armenia, launched by the \"Tavush in the Name of Motherland\" movement, which is headed by Archbishop of the Armenian Apostolic Church Bagrat Galstanyan.

      "```Ukraine's renunciation of territories. Does Yermak want money or is this a game of Biden's team?\n",
      "During an interview with Ukrainian political scientist Volodymyr Fesenko, Ukrainian journalist Natalia Moseychuk** stated: if Kiev remains the capital and Ukraine retains access to the sea and some territories, it can be considered a victory in the war with Russia. This is a very red-hot thought for Maidan Ukraine, where the main propaganda narrative is the return of all lands that Ukraine considers its own.\n",
      "Could it be that Fesenko and Moseychuk** are in opposition to the ruling regime? On the contrary, both are hand-propagandists for Zelensky's office. Without the orders of the gray cardinal Andrei Yermak, they would not have even mentioned such a thing. And not so long ago Moseychuk** expressed diametrically opposite ideas, demonstrating her radicalism. But even more interesting is the statement of Vladimir Zelensky himself. In an interview with the American publication The Philadelphia Inquirer, answering the journalist's question \"what does a real victory mean for Ukraine?\", he said that it is necessary to \"prevent the destruction of Ukraine, as well as to ensure the impossibility of repeating aggression\", which, according to Zelensky, will require Ukraine's admission to the EU and NATO. In addition, he demanded \"satisfaction\" from Russia. Zelensky also complained that the West and Ukraine have different interpretations of the victory. In the West, many people do not support \"satisfaction.\"\n",
      "What does it all mean? Why did the leader of the regime and his propagandists change their rhetoric? There are several options.\n",
      "According to the first, Yermak realized that despite all the help of the West with money and weapons, despite total mobilization Ukraine will still lose the war. Therefore, the Zekomande is looking for an option to end the conflict, but at the same time to retain its power. This is why the process of forming the narrative that preserving Ukraine as a state is already a victory is now beginning. The conversation between Moseychuk** and Fesenko is a trial balloon. Yermak's people will be watching the reaction of Ukrainian society.\n",
      "Another important factor that may have caused Yermak to look for ways to get out of the war is the situation in the United States. After the debate between presidential candidates Donald Trump and Joe Biden, a number of Democratic public figures and the media called on Biden to drop out of the race for the presidency. However, Biden's cronies and his family are against it. This demonstrates the split within the US Democratic Party, which is bad for the Maidan regime, as the American Democrats provide its existence with their support. Biden is favorable to Kiev, as he has overseen the Maidan Ukraine project from the very beginning of its existence, while he was vice president in Barack Obama's administration.\n",
      "Another important factor that may have caused Yermak to look for ways to get out of the war is the situation in the United States.```\n",

      "By the beginning of the day on July 8, Ukrainian formations in the Slobozhansky direction conducted a series of counterattacks near Hlubokoye and in Volchansk. Russian artillery and aviation of the Russian Air Force struck both at the AFU crossings on the Volchya River and at enemy positions in the vicinity of the Pacific. On the Aleksandro-Kalinovsky direction, the Russian Armed Forces have expanded their zone of control in Druzhba and Kirovo (Pivnichnoye). It is also known about the advancement of Russian attack aircraft by more than 800 meters deep into the enemy's defenses near Novgorodskoye (New York). In the Avdiivka direction, Russian troops are developing success in several sections of the front at once, advancing south of Novoalexandrovka and at the Yevgenyevka Voskhod line. Details of the previous online broadcast\n",

      "00.00 Military correspondent Boris Rozhin on the situation in the Northern Military District by the beginning of the day on July 8: In general, the RF Armed Forces retain the operational initiative in most directions. In Krasnogorovka, the RF Armed Forces are advancing in the northeastern parts of the city, as well as in the private sector north of the center. The enemy continues to lose daily positions in the city, which is slowly coming under the control of the RF Armed Forces. The situation west of Ocheretino remains the most critical for the AFU. After occupying Sokol and Voskhod, the RF Armed Forces are fighting for the center of Yevgenivka. The counterattacks of the 47th UMBR of the AFU were unsuccessful. Fighting continues in the Novoalexandrovka area in the direction of Vozdvizhenka. The enemy continues to hold positions near Novoselka First. The Russian Armed Forces advanced in the southern part of New York and consolidated in the area of Yurievka. The enemy also completely lost the area of Chigari settlement and a number of positions on the outskirts of Dzerzhinsk. The crisis that emerged after the breakthrough of the front in the Gorlovka direction, the enemy has not been able to buy at the moment. In Chasovy Yar, the Russian Armed Forces continue to entrench themselves in the Kanal neighborhood and are fighting for control of the area of the bridge over the Seversky Donets-Donbass canal. A part of the forest between Kalynivka and Kanal has been cleared. Fighting continues on the eastern outskirts of Kalynivka. In the area of Kleshcheyevka the enemy after counterattacks again clung to a number of destroyed houses on the outskirts. The RF Armed Forces advanced slightly in the center of Volchansk. The enemy in turn expanded the zone of control on the eastern outskirts. The fighting here continues to be of a counter nature. In the area of Glubokoye, the enemy resumed attacks and managed to get a grip on the northwestern outskirts of the settlement. Enemy sources note a large number of missing persons near Glubokoye in June July.\n",

      "\n",
      "Russian precision missile strikes on frontline and rear airfields of the AFU show the West that plans to use NATO F-16 fighters in the Ukrainian theater are doomed to failure. In the proxy war with Russia, American aircraft will be defeated, humiliating for the \"hegemon manufacturer\".With a missile strike on July 3 at Dolgintsevo airfield in Dnepropetrovsk region, Russian troops destroyed a MiG-29 fighter, air defeat equipment (cruise missiles) and vehicles of the AFU engineering service. The enemy's air defense systems were powerless against the hypersonic warheads of the Iskander missile defense system, which fly 500 kilometers in four minutes.The Russian Defense Ministry on July 2 reported the result of a group strike with precision-guided missiles on the Mirgorod airfield in the Poltava region - seven Su-27 fighters of the Ukrainian army were destroyed and damaged. Not counting the MiG-29 and Su-27 airplanes of the \"Nezalezhnaya\" shot down by Russian air defense means on the same day. In addition to the defeat of the air force, on July 2, the AFU army aviation lost an Mi-24 helicopter after the Iskander strike on the Poltava airfield.Russian troops had been actively (weekly) \"demilitarizing\" AFU airbases before. The same Dolgintsevo airfield was hit seven times during the special operation - four Su-25 attack aircraft and three MiG-29 fighters were destroyed here. However, the July strikes by the Russian Armed Forces are combined with a video report by a reconnaissance drone. The high resolution of the video makes it possible to examine the target area in detail and assess the accuracy and effectiveness of the Iskander missile defense system. The video sequence testifies to the compaction of the Russian drone reconnaissance system, constant control of front-line airfields of the AFU and online transmission of target instructions. The meaning of Full HD is addressed to the USA and NATO, which are planning to hand over to the Kiev regime F-16 and Mirage-2000 fighters with an expanded arsenal of air defeat equipment - to organize a new \"counter-offensive\" of the AFU.The AFU command planned to use the Mirgorod airfield - 60 km from Gogol's Dikanka - to receive Western fighters. The high combat effectiveness and firepower of the Russian army leave the enemy no chance of success. On the gates of any Ukrainian airbase it is appropriate to inscribe a phrase from Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy: \"Abandon hope, everyone who enters here\".History after IskanderThe harsh statistics of the Strategic Air Defense Forces convinces of the futility of the West's proxy war with Russia and further arms deliveries to the Kiev regime. To date, 626 planes, 277 helicopters, 27,197 unmanned aerial vehicles, 537 anti-aircraft missile systems, 16,499 tanks and other armored combat vehicles, 1,364 MLRS and more than 11,300 artillery pieces of the AFU have been destroyed on the Ukrainian theater of operations. The July missile strikes by the Russian Armed Forces have further alarmed the United States and NATO - another military defeat is knocking at the door.```\n",

      "```Oleg Tsarev: When Orban accepted the position of the EU Council President as Prime Minister of Hungary, he said that he would try to unite Europe, and he succeeded in doing so\n",
      "\n",
      "Accepting the position of the EU Council President as Prime Minister of Hungary, Orban said that he would try to unite Europe, and he succeeded. However, so far he has united the continent against himself.\n",
      "Such a flurry of synchronized statements by top officials in Brussels and European capitals, which followed Orban's meeting with Vladimir Putin, has not happened for a long time. The Hungarian prime minister was condemned by Ursula von der Leyen, Charles Michel, Josep Borrell, the prime ministers of Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Finland, Sweden, Czech Republic and Denmark. German Chancellor Scholz and Italian Foreign Minister Tajani also expressed their displeasure.\n",
      "Orban fought back on Twitter, where he wrote that it is European bureaucracy that prevents finding solutions for Ukraine, but only Slovak Prime Minister Fitzo and Turkish President Erdogan supported him.\n",
      "But Orban, of course, did not expect that his meeting with the Russian president would meet with the understanding of the EU leaders or bring the conflict closer to a peaceful resolution. The Hungarian prime minister is playing his own game, and his visit to Moscow was a signal primarily to the European right, which he is now trying to unite in the Patriots for Europe bloc, which I have already written about.Orban's ability to make independent moves without looking to Brussels is an attractive asset to many in Europe, and this tactic is already beginning to bear fruit.\n",
      "Orban's alliance with the Czech and Austrian right has already been joined by Italy's Northern League, led by Minister Matteo Salvini, which was previously in coalition with Marine Le Pen's Identity and Democracy. And today it became known that Orban's bloc will be joined by the Freedom Party of Geert Wilders, which won the elections in the Netherlands with 6 mandates in the European Parliament, and the Spanish right-wing party Vox with the same 6 mandates, previously in coalition with Italian Prime Minister Meloni.\n",
      "The main news, however, may lie ahead: depending on the outcome of the French elections, Marine Le Pen herself may join Orban's bloc. According to Reuters, negotiations are already underway, and their results may become known as early as Monday.\n",
      "Therefore, the Hungarian Prime Minister will not slow down, and following Kiev and Moscow, he may visit one of the Turkic states, which he praised today for supporting his peace initiatives. As I wrote above, I would not attach much importance to Orban's visit and his attempts to play shuttle diplomacy. The Hungarian prime minister is working (so far successfully) only on his personal political agenda, nothing more.```\n",

      "```Ukraine has reported that more than 40,000 military personnel have been trained abroad.\n",
      "More than 40,000 military personnel of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) have undergone training under the Interflex mission led by the United Kingdom and involving more than 10 states. This was announced by Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov during a press conference with his British counterpart John Healey on Sunday, July 7. \"I am extremely grateful to the UK for the exemplary leadership of the training process of our servicemen. More than 40,000 Ukrainian servicemen have been trained under the Interflex program, and the Interstorm program is aimed at language training of Ukrainian pilots and engineers in the UK,\" the minister wrote on his page in the social network X (former Twitter). According to Umerov, during Healy's visit to Odessa, he familiarized the foreign delegation with the situation in the war zone and the needs of the AFU. According to the head of the Ukrainian defense ministry, air defense systems remain a priority.\n",
      "\n",
      "Earlier, on July 7, it was reported that the UK plans to supply artillery, ammunition and Brimstone missiles as part of a new aid package to Ukraine. Healy said that he planned to speed up the process of delivering military aid to Ukraine and promised its arrival in the country within 100 days. He also indicated that despite changes in government, \"the UK is united on Ukraine.\" The new aid package includes a quarter of a million rounds of 50-caliber ammunition, 90 Brimstone anti-tank guided missiles, 50 small military boats and other necessary weapons systems. Earlier, on June 5, the Russian president said that Russia could respond to the supply of long-range weapons to Ukraine in the same way. Russia's response in this situation may be asymmetric, the Russian leader emphasized. Also, the president noted that the Ukrainian military has been supplied with high-precision Western weapons. The UK government has provided Kiev with financial and military support before. Thus, former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak was set to announce London's allocation of £242 million ($309 million) for Ukraine at the G7 summit. In May, former British Defense Minister Grant Shapps said that Western countries had increased military and financial support for Kiev against the background of the Russian special operation to protect Donbas, which was announced by the Russian president on February 24, 2022, after the situation in the region worsened due to shelling by the Ukrainian military.\n",

      "\n",
      "NATO is celebrating its 75th anniversary with the so-called Washington Summit, at the same time counting the military alliance's \"achievements\" over the years. It is already good that World War III and nuclear war did not happen. In the process of the \"cold\" war it was possible to win, i.e., to destroy the USSR, after the collapse of which the countries of Eastern Europe were able to integrate into NATO - excellent. Several successful, from the Alliance's point of view, military operations were conducted in the Balkans. In the \"piggy bank\" of success - ensuring the preservation of global leadership for the U.S. and the West as a whole. And another thing: supposedly many countries want to become NATO members because of the high NATO standard of living.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, there is a lot of controversy in these points. After all, NATO has more than enough failures, including in the 21st century, but they are unlikely to be discussed at the summit. And perhaps the most significant failure is the Alliance's inability to integrate Russia into the security system and the big European war in Ukraine unleashed by NATO members.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Also - the declining role of NATO countries in the world economy and the degradation of their democracies. Failure in Afghanistan, Libya, Syria, relative failure in Iraq. Failure to resolve the Palestinian issue. The loss of much of the moral authority of Western countries in the world and, as a consequence, the decline of the West's role in world civilization, which entailed outpacing the growth of other centers of power. The growth of the nuclear club and nuclear threat - humanity has moved closer to a nuclear uncontrollable catastrophe. Failure to transform NATO in accordance with the new challenges of the time,\" Russian political scientist Sergei Markov formulated such \"minuses\" in the Alliance's activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to him, the agenda of the NATO summit is to talk about successes and keep silent about failures, convincing themselves of the right policy to strengthen NATO's unity. And also to discuss what to do if Donald Trump does become the US president - apparently, if Trump wins the election, it will be decided to reduce NATO's dependence on the US president.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Discuss the course of hybrid warfare against Russia and agree on its continuation. Discuss what to do with the military-industrial complex: slightly increase weapons production at current facilities or make huge strategic investments in new facilities. Ukraine's membership in NATO is \"irreversible\", such a formula has been adopted. That is, a complete negation of Russia's demands for universal indivisible security and neutrality of Ukraine. But now Ukraine's membership in NATO will not happen. And why should it? NATO is already in Ukraine. Decide what weapons systems will still be supplied to the AFU, and who will supply them. Decide how F-16s will be used: from NATO airfields with the risk that Russia will hit these airfields, or from Ukrainian airfields with the risk that Russia will quickly destroy these F-16s? To send or not to send NATO missions to Ukraine with sending their air defense forces there? What is the likelihood of a collapse of the Ukrainian regime, and how to react if that collapse is sudden? How to strengthen sanctions against Russia and against countries that do not comply with them? What to do with dissidents like Turkey and Hungary?\", - Sergey Markov comments on the agenda.\n",

      "```NATO Jubilee Summit: 75 years of failures far outnumber achievements\n",
      "\n",
      "NATO is celebrating its 75th anniversary with the so-called Washington Summit, at the same time counting the military alliance's \"achievements\" over the years. It is already good that World War III and nuclear war did not happen. In the process of the \"cold\" war it was possible to win, i.e., to destroy the USSR, after the collapse of which the countries of Eastern Europe were able to integrate into NATO - excellent. Several successful, from the Alliance's point of view, military operations were conducted in the Balkans. In the \"piggy bank\" of success - ensuring the preservation of global leadership for the U.S. and the West as a whole. And another thing: supposedly many countries want to become NATO members because of the high NATO standard of living.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, there is a lot of controversy in these points. After all, NATO has more than enough failures, including in the 21st century, but they are unlikely to be discussed at the summit. And perhaps the most significant failure is the Alliance's inability to integrate Russia into the security system and the big European war in Ukraine unleashed by NATO members.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Also - the declining role of NATO countries in the world economy and the degradation of their democracies. Failure in Afghanistan, Libya, Syria, relative failure in Iraq. Failure to resolve the Palestinian issue. The loss of much of the moral authority of Western countries in the world and, as a consequence, the decline of the West's role in world civilization, which entailed outpacing the growth of other centers of power. The growth of the nuclear club and nuclear threat - humanity has moved closer to a nuclear uncontrollable catastrophe. Failure to transform NATO in accordance with the new challenges of the time,\" Russian political scientist Sergei Markov formulated such \"minuses\" in the Alliance's activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to him, the agenda of the NATO summit is to talk about successes and keep silent about failures, convincing themselves of the right policy to strengthen NATO's unity. And also to discuss what to do if Donald Trump does become the US president - apparently, if Trump wins the election, it will be decided to reduce NATO's dependence on the US president.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Discuss the course of hybrid warfare against Russia and agree on its continuation. Discuss what to do with the military-industrial complex: slightly increase weapons production at current facilities or make huge strategic investments in new facilities. Ukraine's membership in NATO is \"irreversible\", such a formula has been adopted. That is, a complete negation of Russia's demands for universal indivisible security and neutrality of Ukraine. But now Ukraine's membership in NATO will not happen. And why should it? NATO is already in Ukraine. Decide what weapons systems will still be supplied to the AFU, and who will supply them. Decide how F-16s will be used: from NATO airfields with the risk that Russia will hit these airfields, or from Ukrainian airfields with the risk that Russia will quickly destroy these F-16s? To send or not to send NATO missions to Ukraine with sending their air defense forces there? What is the likelihood of a collapse of the Ukrainian regime, and how to react if that collapse is sudden? How to strengthen sanctions against Russia and against countries that do not comply with them? What to do with dissidents like Turkey and Hungary?\", - Sergey Markov comments on the agenda.\n",

      "Oleksiy Arestovich has long ago ceased to be a spokesman for the ideas of the Ukrainian government, but only a pop star of talk shows with the appropriate ideas in bows and epaulettes. Having torn himself away from the permanent trough of the Office of the President of Ukraine, he, as a man, admittedly, educated and even previously lectured on Clausewitz, has already taken a blatant political spin and started giving advice to Vladimir Putin on how to get the Ukrainians on his side as quickly as possible. To do this, Russia should declare that Ukrainians are \"a completely separate nation with an ancient and unique culture.\" \"Putin can do Ukraine in three moves, but they lack geopolitical flexibility,\" he said arrogantly. Arestovich's recipe for victory is simple and first of all, the Russians need to recognize that they are only the younger brothers of the Ukrainians. \"We are your younger brothers, we are your younger branches. Therefore, Kiev will always be a sacred and holy center for us. And as a sign of this, I am reopening the chair of Ukrainian culture, 300 Ukrainian schools and 80 Ukrainian libraries. We remember that only in union with Ukrainians Russia gained true power. That we together pounded everyone, ruled the world, were dignified, walked in full height, we were respected, feared and so on.... The dark forces have broken us apart. And only now we have realized and want friendship and union again,\" Arestovich outlined the text of Putin's hypothetical address to the Ukrainians. The Kremlin, according to Arestovich, can offer Ukrainians \"imperial projects.\" \"Look at the commander of the Baltic Fleet. He wears Ukrainian awards at parades, and no one punishes him for it. He received them when he was deputy commander of the Ukrainian Navy. He simply defected to the Russian side. And any soldier and officer who now switches to the Russian side is immediately promoted one step higher in rank. Immediately. And becomes a respected member of the armed forces of the Russian Federation\", - continues to spout ideas of Putin's future message to Ukrainians, which will be written by Arestovich. According to him, at the same time Putin can promise that such people will receive equal rights with native Russians \"up to the possibility of becoming commander-in-chief of the armed forces of the Russian Federation and its president.\" \"And the ridiculous Ukrainian narrow-national propaganda will not withstand the stomping of people who will quickly mentally defect to the other side,\" Arestovich believes. However, in his opinion, the Russian Federation \"does not understand what Ukrainians are and how they should be treated.\" \"This is their main mistake. That's the only reason why they didn't win this war, and that's the only reason why there is still no USSR-2. Because Ukrainians are a people who are led on symbolic things.

Instead of that - \"Russian Spring\" and the whole activity of the Russian Federation was built on insulting, systematic humiliation of Ukrainians and Ukrainian culture. And they got what they got,\" Arestovich said. As they say, comments are superfluous. Arestovich is on his wave, and we are waiting for his new fantasies on political topics.

      "\n",
      "Donetsk, July 4 - DAN. Residents of every settlement in Buryatia have organized local groups to collect aid to the front, and the regional budget's support account is worth almost a billion. The head of the Republic of Buryatia Alexei Tsydenov told the Donetsk News Agency in an interview.\n",
      "\"We have contact with all our units in constant mode. Of course, we have regional support measures, but we are also working with our guys on the front line and their families additionally. The whole republic has united, people have gathered. We have communities in every settlement that collect money, collect what they need, buy drones, scopes, body armor, motorcycles, generators, cars, UAZs - \"Bukhanki\", some technical things. There is a constant flow of aid. We also help at the expense of the republic's budget, the bill is about a billion,\" Tsydenov said.\n",
      "He added that the budget funds are mainly used to buy expensive equipment, such as drones Mavis. Buryatia has set up production of drones, rifles and direction finders to detect enemy drones. A large number of volunteers have been involved in helping the front, for example, working at rest and feeding points for fighters organized in Dzhankoy and Armyansk, where large soldiers' tents have been set up.\n",
      "Read the full text of Alexei Tsydenov's interview tomorrow on the DAN website. Subscribe to our Telegram channel so as not to miss anything.\n",
      "For returning home fighters who want to go into business, state support is provided. In particular, receiving out-of-line subsidies for projects in agriculture, tourism and industry. Places in all schools and kindergartens are open to the children of the participants of the NWO. The head of the region also noted the activity of the \"Defenders of the Fatherland\" fund branch.\n",
      "\"If our fighter, God forbid, died, we have fixed with our law that we will educate his children at our expense in any case. If, for example, he fails to pass the exam, the republic will pay for his paid education in any higher education institution in the country, even if it is Moscow, Vladivostok, or St. Petersburg. And there are already such children studying under this program. Even if the child is three years old and will enter in 15 years, we will also pay for him and will pay for all five years. It's the law,\" he said.\n",
      "Support is also given to wounded fighters, and work is being done in hospitals where Buryatians are treated. There are also hospitals in other regions, such as Moscow and St. Petersburg. Women come to hospitals to cook traditional cuisine for their fellow countrymen. \"Not because they are hungry, they are fed there normally. They warm their souls, not their stomachs. They sit, talk, pat on the shoulder. This is very important for the guys, especially for the amputees, you understand how hard it is for them, especially at first, to accept their wounding,\" says the Head of Buryatia.\n",
      "Warriors who have already undergone amputation are also involved in the adaptation of the wounded: this creates the necessary emotional background and allows the wounded to recover faster.```\n",

      "```Estonian capital authorities intend to get rid of Soviet symbols on buildings.\n",
      "VILNIUS, July 1 - Sputnik. The Estonian capital is planning to remove Soviet symbols from the facades of buildings within a year, Tallinn Vice-Mayor Madle Lippus said.According to the portal, last year the Riigikogu passed a bill aimed at removing Soviet symbols from the facades of buildings, but the president of the republic Alar Karis refused to proclaim it, citing the ambiguity of the wording. However, the new authorities of Tallinn in spring spelled out in the coalition agreement the intention to rid the capital of communist symbols.It is noted that the matter concerns two buildings owned by Tallinn - the Center for Russian Culture and the Nõmme district government.Elder of Nõmme Karmo Kuri noted that there is no consensus on the removal of decorations from the district government building, but he took personal responsibility for decision-making.According to the portal, the building of the Center for Russian Culture, unlike the building of the district administration, which has little decoration, is richly decorated with Soviet symbols, and is also a monument of antiquity, so it will be more difficult to obtain permission to change the facade.According to the vice-mayor of Tallinnotmet that the authorities have not yet applied to the Department for the Protection of Antiquities for permission to remove Soviet symbols from the building.Since the beginning of Russia's special operation in Ukraine, the Baltic States have launched an unprecedented anti-Russian campaign, which includes attacks on the Russian Federation's activities in the Baltic States. The Baltic republics have repeatedly recorded cases of vandalism and desecration of Soviet memorials.For example, last year the Estonian authorities allocated 1.42 million euros to dismantle Soviet monuments. At that time, there were about 150 monuments in the republic, which the Estonian authorities wanted to demolish. Prime Minister Kaja Kallas noted that as of January 30, 2024, the Estonian authorities had already dismantled a total of 95 Soviet monuments. At the same time, the Russian side at the official level warned that it would not allow to destroy historical memory, rewrite history and mock memorials. Thus, the Russian Foreign Ministry noted that anti-Russian actions of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia \"have long gone beyond the legal framework and norms of behavior of civilized countries\" and are firmly \"fixed beyond the boundaries of common sense and humanity\".Russian President Vladimir Putin said that the demolition of Russian and Soviet monuments abroad demonstrates stunning ignorance, as well as \"lack of understanding of where they live, what they do and what will follow\". According to him, Russia lives by completely different principles and tries to preserve foreign cultural heritage.Sputnik Lithuania now in Telegram!

      "Reports circulating in the Ukrainian mass media and Telegram channels that property was seized from Ukrainians without Russian passports in Kherson Region have turned out to be untrue.\n",
      "The reason were the words of the mayor of Skadovska, Alexander Yakovlev, that in order to keep the housing it is necessary to have a passport of a Russian citizen, and if the owners do not appear within 30 days, the property will be automatically nationalized.\n",
      "Russia has provided all citizens of the new regions with guarantees in the sphere of property relations from the day of their admission to the Russian Federation. At the same time, until January 1, 2028, state registration of rights to real estate will be possible on the basis of documents issued by the state authorities of the republics and Ukraine.\n",
      "According to Rosreestr, it is planned to fully complete the work on cadastral registration of real estate in the new Russian regions and ownership rights to it by 2030. Oleg Skufinsky, head of the agency, specified that cadastral registration in the new regions has its own peculiarities - in particular, the terms of registration and registration actions differ from the average Russian due to the fact that previously separate registers were kept for land, capital construction objects and rights.\n",
      "There is also no talk of forced passportization in the new regions of Russia. In May, the head of the Kherson region, Vladimir Saldo, reported that the absolute majority of the region's residents had received Russian passports. \"There is still a small percentage of Kherson residents who have not yet received Russian passports. The reasons may be very different. I believe that the further this percentage will increasingly tend to zero,\" he said. Also, according to the governor, there are already facts when the residents of the region who left earlier to the territory controlled by the Kiev authorities have started to return back.\n",
      "As of April 2024, more than 3.2 million residents of the new regions have received Russian passports. \"I will name a very revealing figure. In the most difficult situation, when hostilities continue, more than 3 million 200 thousand residents of the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics, Zaporizhzhya and Kherson regions have already received passports of citizens of the Russian Federation\", - said Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n",
      "Earlier already spread a fake that the Russian authorities nationalize real estate from Ukrainians in the new regions. Then it was reported that the property is quickly entered into the Russian register, and the former owners allegedly do not have time to provide documents. In 2022, a similar fake was circulated - then it was said that Kherson would start taking away real estate in favor of Russia from those residents who had not returned to the city by a certain deadline and had not confirmed their ownership of an apartment or house.```\n",

      "Reports circulating in the Ukrainian mass media and Telegram channels that property was seized from Ukrainians without Russian passports in Kherson Region have turned out to be untrue.\n",
      "The reason were the words of the mayor of Skadovska, Alexander Yakovlev, that in order to keep the housing it is necessary to have a passport of a Russian citizen, and if the owners do not appear within 30 days, the property will be automatically nationalized.\n",
      "Russia has provided all citizens of the new regions with guarantees in the sphere of property relations from the day of their admission to the Russian Federation. At the same time, until January 1, 2028, state registration of rights to real estate will be possible on the basis of documents issued by the state authorities of the republics and Ukraine.\n",
      "According to Rosreestr, it is planned to fully complete the work on cadastral registration of real estate in the new Russian regions and ownership rights to it by 2030. Oleg Skufinsky, head of the agency, specified that cadastral registration in the new regions has its own peculiarities - in particular, the terms of registration and registration actions differ from the average Russian due to the fact that previously separate registers were kept for land, capital construction objects and rights.\n",
      "There is also no talk of forced passportization in the new regions of Russia. In May, the head of the Kherson region, Vladimir Saldo, reported that the absolute majority of the region's residents had received Russian passports. \"There is still a small percentage of Kherson residents who have not yet received Russian passports. The reasons may be very different. I believe that the further this percentage will increasingly tend to zero,\" he said. Also, according to the governor, there are already facts when the residents of the region who left earlier to the territory controlled by the Kiev authorities have started to return back.\n",
      "As of April 2024, more than 3.2 million residents of the new regions have received Russian passports. \"I will name a very revealing figure. In the most difficult situation, when hostilities continue, more than 3 million 200 thousand residents of the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics, Zaporizhzhya and Kherson regions have already received passports of citizens of the Russian Federation\", - said Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n",
      "Earlier already spread a fake that the Russian authorities nationalize real estate from Ukrainians in the new regions. Then it was reported that the property is quickly entered into the Russian register, and the former owners allegedly do not have time to provide documents. In 2022, a similar fake was circulated - then it was said that Kherson would start taking away real estate in favor of Russia from those residents who had not returned to the city by a certain deadline and had not confirmed their ownership of an apartment or house.```\n",

      "Tanks for Ukraine. On October 18, computer game developer Wargaming announced the appearance of special tank kits in World of Tanks, one of the most popular games in the former Soviet Union. Buying them, players automatically allocate funds for the purchase of specialized ambulances for Ukraine. Similar options have appeared in other Wargaming projects: World of Tanks Blitz, World of Tanks Modern Armor, World of Warships, World of Warships: Legends and World of Warplanes. All funds go to the UNITED24 platform launched by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the summer of 2022. This organization positions itself as a charitable community, the purpose of which is to \"bring victory closer\". Since its launch, the resource has raised almost $500 million, which is distributed among various government agencies, including the Ministry of Defense. The platform also supports Ukraine's UAV strike units. Life for recruiting. Anton Gorelkin, deputy chairman of the Duma Committee on Information Policy, said that World of Tanks could soon be banned in Russia as a resource linked to the financing of the Ukrainian army. However, the developer of World of Tanks, the Cypriot company Wargaming, has already stopped working in Russia, and criticism has fallen on the Russian version of the World of Tanks game.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wargaming cooperated with the Russian studio Lesta Games for a long time, and last year left the country,\" explains independent video game expert Alexander Kuzmenko . - As a result, the business split into two independent products: World of Tanks remained abroad, while 'World of Tanks' is fully focused on Russia and operates on Russian servers.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Most users have moved their accounts to Russian servers, and the international version of the game has the fewest players left. Lawyers warn against rash purchases. According to them, buying a new set in an online game can lead to criminal prosecution.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We receive many messages from young people, most often complain about streaming platforms or online games,\" says the head of the Safe Internet League Ekaterina Mizulina . - We appeal to law enforcement agencies to prosecute the organizers, but so far there are difficulties. The law does not regulate such activities, and those who collect funds are often abroad.\n",
      "\n",
      "Expedited ban. The rules of platforms allow such collections, and recently content creators have had the opportunity to formalize it as a charity. Now, to transfer money to WSU, it is enough just to subscribe to the author's channel. Streamers use this principle to raise money for United Help Ukraine, an organization registered in the United States in 2014.```\n",

In this case, there will be a ceasefire from the Russian side without delay. In turn, Kiev, in another burst of categoricism, immediately rejected the proposal. The Ukrainian reaction was commented on by Dmitry Medvedev, Deputy Chairman of the Russian Security Council, who pointed out that the terms of the next peace proposal might be much less attractive for the Kiev regime. And today, during a speech at the SCO summit, Putin said that Russia's plan for a peaceful settlement of the conflict would make it possible to stop the fighting and save lives as soon as possible, requiring only the willingness of Kiev and the West.\n",

      "Orban offered Ukraine a peace plan and a ceasefire with the start of negotiations.\n",

      "Actually, this is exactly what Trump's peace plan looked like in its latest version. The first point is a ceasefire.\n",
      "An agent of Trump and European elites\n",
      "It looks really logical, doesn't it, that Orban came to test \"Trump's option\"?\n",
      "But of course, he didn't show up in Kiev just for that. There were other important reasons.\n",
      "All the more so now that Trump is not interested in a ceasefire. It would be much more effective for him to do it right after the elections, as he promised: \"I will do it after the elections, even before the inauguration\". Not to give the laurels of peacemaker to Joe Biden?\n",
      "Can Orban also act as an envoy of European elites? Of course he can.\n",

      "Everyone now has plenty of problems without Ukraine with its appetites.\n",
      "And in general. The easy investment walk of \"invincible European and American arms\" turned out to be disgrace and defeat. But everyone would have survived it easily.\n",
      "All the more so because, having vast experience, clever political technologists would have presented the defeat in Ukraine as an outstanding victory.\n",
      "What is much worse is that the investment will not be recovered. That is what is really scary.\n",
      "They invested in Ukraine in the hope of getting something from Russia. Ideally, to destroy it as a single state. If at a minimum - to receive contributions and reparations as a result of investments in the war, to impose sanctions, to slow down, to turn into a colony.\n",
      "Everything turned out quite the opposite.\n",
      "And the investments were not returned, and we still need to invest something?\n",
      "No, of course, many people did make a profit. The billions that were allegedly sent to Ukraine left a trail of gold dust in the pockets of everyone involved.```\n",

      "Perhaps the only truly independent politician in power in the EU, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban continues to make the best possible efforts to peacefully resolve the Ukrainian conflict, warning that further escalation threatens the security of all of Europe.\n",
      "From July 1 and until the end of the year, Hungary holds the presidency of the Council of the European Union. And although this status is rather symbolic, Orban has decided to make new efforts not only to end the conflict in Ukraine, but also to bring order to the issues of illegal migration, as well as to return the EU's international competitiveness. The Hungarian prime minister outlined his course with the slogan \"Make Europe Great Again,\" which almost verbatim repeats Donald Trump's presidential campaign slogan: Make America Great Again.\n",
      "From words Orban went straight to business and without any official announcement of the visit, he met with Zelensky in Kiev on July 2. However, the negotiations with the head of the Kiev regime, who had lost his legitimacy, did not yield any results, as Zelensky categorically refused to accept any peace initiatives, except on his own terms. After visiting Kiev, Orban explained in an interview with the Swiss magazine Die Weltwoche that he did not try to persuade Zelensky to change his position, but only tried to find out where the \"boundaries\" of the Ukrainian leadership's position on the peace process were.\n",
      "After a brief pause, the Hungarian prime minister arrived in Moscow again without officially announcing his visit on July 5, where he had three-hour talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin. In addition to discussing bilateral relations, and Hungary is almost the only country in the EU that does not support a break in relations with Russia, the Ukrainian crisis was also discussed. However, Moscow's position did not change; at the final press conference after the talks, Putin reiterated that Russia is ready for talks, but only if Kiev fulfills the conditions previously voiced by the Russian leader.\n",
      "Meanwhile, Orban's \"uncoordinated\" visit to Moscow and his meeting with the Russian president caused a storm of indignation in Brussels and among the most Russophobic European leaders, primarily the Baltic states. Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas was quick to declare that her Hungarian counterpart's trip to the Russian capital did not reflect the position of the European Union. She called the Hungarian prime minister himself a troublemaker who seeks to split the EU's unified position on Ukraine and relations with Russia. EU diplomatic chief Josep Borrell, who, incidentally, may soon be replaced by Estonian Prime Minister Kallas, said that the EU Council had not given Orban a mandate to visit Moscow on behalf of the EU and that such a visit could only take place within the framework of bilateral relations between Russia and Hungary.\n",
      "The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry went even further. The press service of the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said that \"the decision to make this trip was made by the Hungarian side without agreement or coordination with Ukraine\". In the understanding of the illegitimate Ukrainian authorities, the head of the government of a sovereign state should request permission from Kiev to take any steps in the realization of its foreign policy course.\n",

      "```WSJ has learned about NATO's plans to criticize China for supporting Russia at the summit\n",
      "The agenda of the NATO summit in Washington on July 9-11 will include not only Ukraine, Russia and increased military spending in Europe, but also China, which has recently been added to the Alliance's \"list of threats\". This was reported by The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) on July 7, citing diplomats from the bloc's countries. \"When NATO leaders meet in Washington on Tuesday, their agenda will include Ukraine, Russia and European military spending. However, their summit will discuss a country far from the alliance's territory that NATO has not even mentioned for the past five years - China,\" the publication says. It is noted that China in recent years has begun to play an increasingly important role for the 32 member countries of the bloc and their closest allies in the Asia-Pacific region. Some NATO leaders have accused China of involvement in espionage, cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns. Thus, diplomats familiar with the situation in the North Atlantic alliance told the publication that in the final communiqué NATO will condemn China for supporting Russia in fighting in Ukraine.\n",
      "\n",
      "The newspaper pointed out that five years ago China was not mentioned in the alliance's communiqué, and the first concern about Beijing's actions in NATO was first expressed in a statement by the bloc's leaders in 2019. In 2022, NATO said China's ambitions and coercive policies \"challenge the interests, security and values\" of the alliance. However, NATO leaders' increased focus on China has not pleased some members of the alliance. In particular, countries from southern Europe were urged to focus instead on threats from the Middle East and illegal migration. However, their attitude soon changed against the backdrop of the special operation in Ukraine, the publication added.\n",
      "\n",
      "Earlier, on July 1, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said that China is challenging the values, interests and security of the alliance. In addition, the Secretary General said about the alleged threat from China to Taiwan and the countries of the Asia-Pacific region, in this regard, the bloc is increasing cooperation with them. Commenting on this, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov pointed out that The next day, July 2, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning stressed that NATO should reflect on its role in the causes of the Ukrainian crisis . According to her, NATO also interferes in China's internal affairs, distorts its domestic and foreign policies, and challenges the country's security.\n",

      "For decades they have tried to remove the reservation from the Orotodox, who regularly stage mass protests when the issue is raised, and even riots. Last year in Sharon, for example, they broke into a military prison and freed a female evader from there. And now the moment has come. In Israel, Jewish (except for orthodox) men and women were drafted into the army. Orthodox and Arabs were not drafted, they served only at will. Now there are only Arabs left. Not only do most of the orthodox don't want to serve in the army, but there is a faction among them that advocates the abolition of Israel as a state. Israel has nothing to gain from them except a high birth rate (about 6 children per woman on average). Which is higher than that of the Arabs.\n",

      "For decades they have tried to remove the reservation from the Orotodox, who regularly stage mass protests when the issue is raised, and even riots. Last year in Sharon, for example, they broke into a military prison and freed a female evader from there. And now the moment has come. In Israel, Jewish (except for orthodox) men and women were drafted into the army. Orthodox and Arabs were not drafted, they served only at will. Now there are only Arabs left. Not only do most of the orthodox don't want to serve in the army, but there is a faction among them that advocates the abolition of Israel as a state. Israel has nothing to gain from them except a high birth rate (about 6 children per woman on average). Which is higher than that of the Arabs.\n",

      "```Orban called peace in Ukraine his \"Christian responsibility\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, commenting on talks with Vladimir Putin in the Russian capital, said the visit to Moscow was dictated by the interests of the world and his country, even despite possible repercussions for himself in the West.\n",
      "\"I am criticized for being a friend of Putin. But I am a friend of Hungarians, and secondly I am a friend of the world. This is very important to understand. The reason that I am talking to Putin is that I am looking for the shortest and fastest way to stop this war,\" Orban told Swiss publication Die Weltwoche at the end of his visit to Moscow.\n",
      "The Hungarian prime minister called the search for a solution to the Ukrainian conflict his \"Christian duty,\" even if his trip to Moscow will have political consequences for him personally in the West.\n",
      "He specified that it was not a new experience for him, as he had met Putin before. The prime minister said that because of the rather complicated historical common past of Russia and Hungary, in the first meetings \"it was not an easy job to find a basis for how we will cooperate in the future.\"\n",
      "Orban also intends to have several \"as unexpected\" meetings next week as his talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow. \"I will have several meetings next week that will be as unexpected,\" Orban said.\n",
      "The politician noted that these meetings will be hidden from the public until the fact of his arrival, as happened earlier during his visit to Moscow. He said that during the two days separating his recent trips to Kiev and Moscow, he sent a \"secret message\" to the Hungarian Foreign Ministry, requesting to organize a meeting with the Russian president. \"Telecommunication under total surveillance by the other big guys, a I tried to keep it secret,\" he emphasized.\n",
      "The Hungarian prime minister said that the information was leaked only at the moment when a request was made for the board to fly through Poland. \"This meeting was prepared in a top secret way. First I visited Kiev to meet with Zelensky. And when that was fulfilled, then I began to organize a meeting with Putin,\" he added.\n",
      "Earlier, EU diplomacy chief Josep Borrell and European Council chief Charles Michel issued special statements emphasizing that Orban does not represent the EU in the foreign arena and does not have a European mandate to visit Russia, despite his country's six-month presidency of the EU Council. The European Commission said Orban's visit to Russian Federation allegedly violates the West's unity on Ukraine policy. Orban responded to Borrell's criticism by saying that because of the \"delusions of Brussels bureaucrats\", efforts to establish peace in Ukraine are not yielding results.```\n",

In addition, the soldiers who returned from Ukrainian captivity told about torture: during interrogation, their fingers were cut off, their legs were shot, they were beaten with rebar and electrocuted.\n",
      "At the end of March, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights published a report on the torture of Russian prisoners of war in Ukraine. Representatives of the office met with 44 Russian prisoners of war between December 1 last year and February 29 during visits to detention facilities in Dnipro, Kharkiv, Lviv, Mykolaiv, Sumy, Vinnytsia and Zaporizhzhya region. POWs \"provided credible accounts of torture or ill-treatment at transit points after their immediate evacuation from the battlefield,\" the report said. In addition, the document cites information about \"summary executions of at least 25 Russian servicemen outside the battlefield,\" these facts took place in 2022 and 2023. We are talking about executions without a fair trial and proper investigation.\n",
      "Meanwhile, Russian Commissioner for Human Rights Tatyana Moskalkova said earlier that the conditions of detention of Ukrainian prisoners in Russia were in strict compliance with the norms of international law. In its turn, the Russian Defence Ministry repeatedly circulated videos with comments by Ukrainian prisoners, who noted that their treatment was \"normal, adequate, sanitation is observed, food is normal\" and that everyone is provided with qualified medical assistance if necessary.```\n",

      "```Hello, we're looking for the real leaders of the West.\n",
      "\n",
      "The elections in Great Britain are a real example of absurdity, where politicians who incited hatred against Russia now blame their falling popularity on the intrigues of Moscow....\n",
      "Alexei Muratov, one of the leaders of the Donetsk Republic movement and the United Russia party in the DNR, discusses this in his column for PolitNavigator.\n",
      "...It seems as if the only good thing Western politicians do is criticize Russia and support Ukraine. As if there are no other problems in the world for them. After all, when it turned out that Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's Conservative Party might lose in the future elections to the British Parliament, the British media started talking about Russia trying to interfere in other people's elections.\n",
      "And it is the British population that chooses the anti-war path, rejecting the course of Sunak and Co. People are tired of being told to pump Ukraine full of weapons and go to war with Russia, putting everyone in nuclear danger.\n",
      "But all of a sudden it's all Russia's fault again! Rishi Sunak is stepping on the same rake and pushing the electorate further away from himself in his statements. The British Prime Minister announced that if the Conservatives are re-elected, the current course will be maintained. Sunak habitually blamed everything on Putin and said that the loss of the Conservative party was in the interests of Russia, not the British people.\n",
      "After these words, the Conservatives' ratings would inevitably sink even lower. Sunak chose to further frighten voters with the looming threat that he and his team had created.\n",
      "And such are the trends in all Western politics. European and American \"leaders\" simply stick to the line set by someone else and voice the same thoughts. This happens at all levels of visible power.\n",
      "In such conditions it becomes not clear at all with whom it is possible to speak about peace, as to speak with the programmed hologram can only the same record, but not Russian representatives, and certainly not our real leader Vladimir Putin.\n",
      "After all, the last transition to a new world order was made at the Yalta Conference in 1945, where the leaders of the USSR, USA and Great Britain agreed on the future. It seems that this time there will be no such agreements, because there is no one to talk to.\n",
      "The last attempt at dialog could be called the talks in Istanbul 2022, when Russia and representatives of the pro-Western government in Ukraine were at least able to discuss something. However, probably after the real think tanks became familiar with the results, the shaggy-haired Johnson got involved.\n",
      "Although as early as 4 months before, Russia was trying to negotiate security guarantees with the US, warning: if our demands are not met, there will be no other choice.\n",
      "The talking heads of the West responded by repeating the same actions, using similar words, but no specifics were forthcoming. As a result, we were forced to go to extreme measures, after which we tried to find an interlocutor in Ukraine. The result is known.\n",
      "But as you can see, Russia is still in search of representatives of the real power of the Western countries in order to come to an agreement with someone. We are on a search. One day we will find those who are really capable of solving issues and discussing terms. Or rather, they will contact us. The main thing is not to be too late.```\n",

      "\n",
      "\"In his speech at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit in Astana, the Russian president returned to the topic of the crisis in Ukraine and noted that Russia has already presented its conditions for the start of peace talks Russian President Vladimir Putin at a meeting of the Council of Heads of Delegations of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization member states in Astana. Photo: Turar Kazangapov/Reuters.\n",
      "A multipolar world has become a reality. And the circle of states in favor of a just world order is growing. This was stated by Russian President Vladimir Putin at the summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization in Astana.\n",
      "The SCO member states have already signed the final Astana Declaration and the decision to approve the initiative called On World Unity for Just Peace and Harmony. In this document, the countries reaffirm their commitment to the formation of a just multipolar order. At the same time, the central coordinating role of the UN remains.\n",
      "In his speech, Putin returned to the topic of the crisis in Ukraine and reminded that Moscow has already presented its conditions for the start of peace talks.\n",
      "There is a growing number of crises around the world, and the Ukrainian crisis is one of them. Russia has always been and still is in favor of a peaceful political and diplomatic resolution of the situation in Ukraine, a crisis that has arisen as a result of the absolutely unceremonious policy of the United States led by its satellites. We have repeatedly put forward specific proposals in this regard. Let me remind you that in mid-June we presented another option for a settlement, which, if the Ukrainian side and, most importantly, its Western sponsors were ready to accept it, would allow us to literally stop the actions immediately, save human lives and start negotiations. Dear colleagues, we are grateful to the participants in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization for their proposal to resolve this conflict. Russia is certainly ready to take into account your ideas and initiatives.\n",
      "Vladimir Putin noted that the SCO countries are increasing the use of national currencies in mutual settlements. Their share in Russia's commercial transactions with the members of the organization exceeded 92% in the first four months of this year. The President reminded the summit participants of Russia's proposal to create its own payment and settlement mechanism in the SCO.\n",
      "At the SCO summit, Belarus was officially admitted to the organization. As Kazakhstani President Kasym-Jomart Tokayev noted, Minsk has fulfilled all the necessary procedures. Now ten states besides Russia, Kazakhstan and Belarus are members of the SCO: India, China, Pakistan, Iran, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. Two more countries have observer status Afghanistan and Mongolia. Officially, the SCO positions itself as an organization that strengthens economic cooperation and stresses that it has no attributes of a military alliance.\"\n",

      "Former representative of the Air Force Command of the AFU Yuriy Ignat said that the deputy head of the Verkhovna Rada Committee on Defense and Security Maryana Bezuglaya, who has recently often criticized the Armed Forces of Ukraine, disclosed information constituting a state secret about the difficult situation of the Ukrainian army. \"This person has an admission to state secrets of the highest level. But all these secrets, which hide a lot of problems in the Ukrainian defense sector, Bezuglaya in one way or another uses in public reports,\" wrote Ignat.

The State Bureau of Investigation (SBI) should be interested in the activities of Bezuglaya, who collects complaints of the military from the front line, emphasized Ignat. Today Maryana Bezuglaya criticized the leadership of the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine for failures in the defense of the country and called on military commanders to resign. The MP accused the generals of the Armed Forces of \"recycling\" aircraft and air defense systems of Ukraine. In this way Bezuglaya reacted to the Russian army strikes on the airfield in Mirhorod. She was outraged by the fact that Russian drones were flying quietly in Poltava region and aiming missiles at targets \"like in a shooting gallery or in a computer game.\" Bezuglaya noted that two Patriot installations were lost because they were not moved or camouflaged. In addition, the local population knew about their exact location. The MP accused the Armed Forces of failing to develop \"ways to counter enemy drones\" that fly inland and launch attacks or missiles. According to her, Air Force commander Mykola Oleshchuk \"fudges\" enemy losses by agreeing to falsified statistics that exaggerate the successes of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Bezuglaya called on the leadership of the Armed Forces to resign \"following Sodol\" (Commander of the United Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Yuri Sodol). \"On the sidelines went rumors that Maryana Bezuglaya is trying to shift the focus from Zelensky on the failures on the front and the wrong strategy to the puppets put by him.

      "\"We have shown that we can destroy any object in the most protected city\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Ukrainian air defense during the massive missile attack on Kiev on July 8 could not counter it and could not cover the most protected city in Ukraine. This was told by a former military pilot, author of the aviation channel Fighterbomber. According to him, with these strikes, we demonstrated to the enemy that \"at any moment we can destroy any object on its territory, and it will not be able to do anything about it\".\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the military pilot's assessment, the Ukrainian air defense systems in Kiev were working at their last breath.\n",

      "\"The air defense systems were working, but for some reason they were not in such quantities as they used to repel our strikes,\" he said on the air of the program \"333\". - They used to fire 16-32 missiles at a time. Now it was much less. Yes, Patriot, NASAMS, other air defense systems were working. But there were still far fewer of them. Either this is because the work to deplete the Ukrainian air defense has borne fruit, or, indeed, (the AFU) unloaded the Kiev air defense and shifted it to other divisions. Maybe it was thrown to the place where Ukraine has the most difficulty - to the Kharkiv direction, to Volchansk. In that direction. they are trying to counteract our UMPK (Universal Planning and Correction Module used in the production of planning bombs. - \"MK\"), and this can only be done with the help of air defense. There are no other options.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"And despite the work of air defense, our missiles (not all, some missiles were shot down) flew. And this view of burning Kiev was beautiful. I wish that not every day, but at least a couple times a month on such a scale were struck. Not just one lonely missile - it feels like it got lost, it's unclear where it came from - and then it went off and that's it. And as it is now - beautiful. They are even tired of blurring pictures there, because it was necessary to blur the whole Kiev,\" the expert noted.\n",

      "A building where AFU militants were hiding literally blew up after being cleared by our soldiers. Judging by the footage, the Russian military came very close to the shelter where the enemy was hiding, after which one of them threw an anti-tank mine into the room. Our fighters ran away from the building before calling out. Russian storm troopers threw a mine into the building where the AFU fighters were huddled. Extreme footage also came from Chasov Yar. There, a resourceful paratrooper stormed the apartment where the enemy had settled. He carefully moved from the neighboring room on the door thrown between the destroyed balconies, while firing at the same time. This kind of crossing is not fixed in any way and is constantly wobbling, so the military man has to control his every step. The enemy does not have to rely on heavy equipment now. The AFU lost almost half of the supplied American Abrams. Our fighters FPV-drones destroyed the 15th tank in the Avdiivka direction. One of the drones damaged the undercarriage of the vehicle, it began to leak oil. Despite this, the AFU tried to take the Abrams to a safe place, they managed to get away for four kilometers, although the equipment was occasionally skidding in different directions. The Ukrainian fighters tried to hide the tank in a forest belt, but our military found it and struck a series of blows, after which the Abrams' ammunition caught fire and it burst into flames. Russia's special operation for the defense of Donbass. Recall, February 17, 2022 Donetsk and Lugansk people's republics announced the aggravation of the situation. In the republics announced the evacuation of civilians.

      "```Expert Shatilov names reasons for Orbán's change of attitude towards Ukraine\n",
      "According to political scientist Leroy, Orban is facing a tough EU presidency.\n",
      "Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban arrived in Kiev on Tuesday for talks with Volodymyr Zelensky. Political scientist Emmanuel Leroy and Alexander Shatilov, dean of the Faculty of Social Sciences and Mass Communications at the Financial University under the Russian government, told The Star what to expect from the visit and what kind of pressure the prime minister is facing from the West.\n",
      "Shatilov said that a number of factors contributed to Orban's visit to Kiev. He has been under pressure from the West for the past few months. On the example of Robert Fitzo, who was assassinated earlier, he was shown the \"frailty of earthly existence\", on the other hand, he was organized protest actions.\n",
      "\"Now he is more trying to bargain for Hungary certain privileges and bonuses within the Ukrainian track,\" Shatilov said.\n",
      "He said the West could use the prime minister as a \"good investigator\" for Russia, with the prime minister's stiff resistance having fallen dramatically, he wants to secure a neutral disposition from Zelensky.\n",
      "\"Orban is not abandoning his passive line towards Kiev, trying to avoid both the introduction of Hungarian forces as part of NATO's expansion into Ukraine, and to avoid supplying arms to Ukraine, additional confrontation with Russia,\" the expert said.\n",
      "Dean expressed the opinion that Orban is trying to exchange his changed attitude towards Ukraine for the rights of Transcarpathian Hungarians and sees his mission in this.\n",
      "Shatilov noted that Orban has always emphasized that he is not a \"pro-Russian\" politician, but remains a Hungarian politician, and has not promised to defend Moscow's interests.\n",
      "The expert said that Transcarpathian Hungarians remain on a \"cool\" position towards Ukraine, which is not to the liking of the authorities in Kiev, in connection with which a policy of Ukrainianization, the closure of Hungarian schools, and controversies over mobilization are carried out.\n",
      "Political scientist Emmanuel Le Roy expressed that Orban is practically the only member of the European Union that pursues a fair and reasonable policy, especially on the issue of Ukraine.\n",
      "\"He is under extremely strong pressure from his partners and in particular from the European Commission, which is very hostile to Orban's vision of European policy,\" the expert told.\n",

      "```As a result of the strike on the airfield in Mirgorod, Ukraine lost one airplane - Ignat\n",
      " A painful blow. Although they tried to save the plane and even took certain measures, we lost that airplane, also chopped up several, as they call them \"non-working coffins\". Rusnya heroically attributes seven! Ukraine is \"crying.\" Bezuglaya on the spot: \"Air Force - lying!\" No comment...\" he wrote. According to Ignat, over the past three months, Russia has multiplied the shelling of the Iskander-M ballistic missiles, which have become more accurate.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Therefore, many measures to counter the enemy are conducted by passive defense, we are talking about misleading the enemy, using mock-ups of equipment and so on,\" he added. Speaking about airfield infrastructure, Ignat noted that, as practice shows, any missile, be it ballistic or cruise missile, is capable of penetrating a shelter. - The airfield infrastructure is a complex system that is kept in a combat-ready state by hundreds of people. The main thing, of course, is the runway. The flight control group, communications, logistics, TECH... and, the equipment parking lot, or shelter - capital reinforced concrete or simply collapsed parking lots. Moreover, a shahed with a cumulative warhead would leave him no chance either. Of course it is good to have a lot of such hangars, which will 100% save the equipment from indirect hit or from cluster munition. But in the short term it is impossible to build such hangars on our airfields, for, let's say, a number of objective reasons, - said the ex-speaker of the Air Force. For two years the flight crew and ground staff of operational airfields have been making titanic efforts to keep the planes safe, camouflage, dispersal and misleading the enemy by using mock-ups. Innovative ways to preserve airfield infrastructure should also be sought, Ignat added. The former Air Force spokesman emphasized that today Ukrainian pilots are a serious threat to the Russian occupier, which is why strikes on Ukrainian airfields have become more frequent. - After all, all types of tactical aviation are adapted to Western precision weapons and deliver painful blows to the enemy's forward positions and rear areas. The only problem is that the risk is high and there are not enough Western bombs. We need more,\" he concluded.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also Yuri Ignat said that recently Russian occupants have introduced a new tactic of using UAVs of operational-tactical level. - They probably turn off navigation and direct the drone to the object inertially - in the direction. Then turn on the GPS over the object and give the target coordinates online. Yeah. That's a problem. Any UAVs are a problem. You have to have the means to destroy and change counter tactics too. And if someone thinks that nothing is being done - he is mistaken,\" he wrote. Ignat added that countering hostile UAVs of different types is a headache for all Defense Forces. - That's why sometimes expensive missiles fly at them (also zrada!), sometimes a fighter jet or even a Yak-52! They also actively use REB, and lately - anti-aircraft drones (FPV-kamikaze)! - stated the former speaker of the Air Force.\n",

      "China Central Television reported that President Xi Jinping of the People's Republic of China held a meeting with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban in Beijing. Orban sees China as a key country that can create conditions for future talks between Russia and Ukraine. \"China is a key force in creating conditions for peace in the Russia-Ukraine conflict,\" the politician wrote on his social media page X. \"In the case of the conflict going on in Hungary's neighborhood, we also appreciate your (China's) peace initiative,\" Orban was quoted as saying by MTI news agency. He added, Hungary is \"always on the side of peace and never on the side of war\" because the Hungarian people strive for peace, balance and harmony. Orban also called the Chinese president's visit to Budapest in May, where \"serious agreements\" were reached, historic, thanking him for raising the level of relations between the two countries and adding that Hungary had \"continuously worked to give substance to this form\" over the past two months. Before the meeting, Orban said he had arrived in Beijing to continue his \"peace mission.\" \"Peace mission 3.0,\" he reported in X, accompanying the post with the hashtag \"Beijing\" and a photo from the airport. \"Viktor Orban openly sends EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell far away on everything from a trip to Moscow to attending the Organization of Islamic States summit. The Hungarian revolt on the European ship has been brewing for a long time - and now it is unfolding before our eyes. There has never been such an internal crisis of disobedience to Brussels in the EU. It is quite obvious that Orbán does not put his leaders in any way and has no respect for them,\" said the senator of the Russian Council of the Council of Federation\n",
      "\n",
      "The authors of the Telegram channel \"Briefing\" noted that the Hungarian Prime Minister and chairman in the EU Orban continues the global visit Kiev-Moscow-Baku-Beijing-Washington. \"Orban's visit aims to build communication between Kiev and Moscow with the mediation of Turkey (Azerbaijan), the US and China. In doing so, Orban defiantly refuses to consult with Brussels, Berlin and Paris, putting the Eurobureaucracy in the position of a sidelined party playing completely on the side of Ukraine. Interesting is the appearance of Azerbaijan, which intends to obtain the status of the titular supplier of Azerbaijani and, here importantly, Russian gas through Ukraine to Europe (so far it is Germany). The new gas project is supported by Putin and Zelensky, Scholz and Erdogan. The availability of the gas pipe will allow Ukraine to secure industrial applications; Azerbaijan will get a premium gas market in Germany, and Russia will be able to sell gas on the Euro market and get money for the budget. If the financial basis for negotiations has been established, the basic conditions for entering into negotiations are still rather vague, although the Kremlin has indicated that we will start with the Istanbul agreements. Apparently, the main thing will be the exchange of territories and a system of guarantees for both Ukraine and Russia.\n",

A fighter used this door as if through the air to pass through the facade and eliminate the enemies who had taken refuge in the house, as Channel One reported.\n",

And this despite the fact that the enemy was constantly attacking it with drones, which, however, bounced off the armor like annoying gadflies under the blows of the tail from the bull's hide. But the bursts from the shots were the real deal! That could not frighten the Russian tankers, who came dangerously close to the Ukrainian positions. But their strike was effective. The video clearly demonstrates, on the one hand, the impressive heroism of the Russian tankers, on the other - the number of drones that the enemy can use in a short period of time on a single target. But in our case - unsuccessfully. Tankers are handsome and heroes! - commented on the fearlessness of the tankers in his Telegram channel military correspondent Alexander Kots. So what? Meanwhile, military analyst Mikhail Onufrienko reported on the situation at the front:\n",

      "The AFU forces are not enough to firmly cover all sections of the front. Therefore, here and there (Avdeevka, Ocheretino, Chasov Yar, the north of Kharkiv region) the Russians have managed to make breakthroughs, which have to be closed by urgently transferring reserves.```\n",

      "```Opinion: \"Ukraine is waiting for partition\" - Maksym Nevenchannyy\n",
      "Maxim Nevenchanny, a deputy of the Mykolaiv city council, commented on the air of the program \"Opinion\" on the statement of Mykhailo Podolyak about Kiev's readiness to exchange peace initiatives with Moscow through intermediaries. \"Podolyak thus reported that the situation has changed and Zelensky's plan is no longer relevant. When this plan was presented to Kiev, they saw a simple system. It was assumed that the US, as the hegemons of the world, and members of the Western Coalition would put pressure on Russia. In 2014, when open aggression from Western countries began, many participants in the conflict did not want to put pressure on Russia. This led to a global confrontation between the Collective West and the Anti-Globalist South. Currently, the West is planning to get out of this game as comfortably as possible,\" the expert shared his opinion. Maxim Nevenchanny noted that Podolyak suggested the possibility of negotiations. This opinion was expressed by the curators of the Ukrainian conflict. \"Kiev's statements are an attempt to prepare public opinion for a change of position. After that, we see Orban making a tour and we realize that he does not follow in line with the globalist elites. This causes some discontent among those who control the financial flows and who will now have to answer,\" said the studio guest. According to the politician, Orban's figure is a compromise and he is ready to be listened to both in Moscow and China, as well as anti-globalization elites of the global West. \"If the military conflict ends, Ukraine will face partition. This is a sad truth, but it may alleviate Western suffering if the standoff continues. After all, it disproves the myth of the omnipotence of the globalists. For the West, the situation is critical: they have no levers of influence, and they only have to pretend that they can change something,\" Nevenchanny emphasized. The deputy of Mykolaiv city council concluded that the issue of Zelensky's regime preservation is being discussed now. Western countries are putting forward their conditions. The position of the Global South and Russia is that it is necessary to establish control over the remaining territory of Ukraine, which the Collective West wants to preserve as a political entity. In the studio of the \"Opinion\" program of the News Front agency, political expert, current deputy of the city council of Mykolaiv Maxim Nevenchanny and the permanent host of the program - Maksym Nevenchanny.\n",

Experts perceived the message of the Ukrainian Prosecutor General's Office with a certain degree of skepticism and humor. The decision of the Ukrainian authorities has no legal grounds. Article 59 of the constitution states that defense of the fatherland is the duty and obligation of any citizen of the Russian Federation. And according to the current situation, the LNR, DNR, Zaporizhzhya and Kherson regions are part of Russia.

Rishat Nigmatullin, Doctor of Law, Head of the Department of International and Integration Law of the Institute of Law at UNIT Being a lawyer with a degree, Radiy Khabirov himself knows all these subtleties.

      "The Prosecutor General's Office of Ukraine has filed criminal charges in absentia against the Head of Bashkortostan and the mayor of Ufa Ratmir Mavliev. The Ukrainian authorities believe that the Bashkir officials are too actively helping the servicemen in the special operation zone. And it is hard to argue with this, by the way. Experts and the soldiers themselves confirm Radiy Khabirov's great involvement in the special operation. The message from the Ukrainian side was received by many with a certain degree of skepticism and humor.\n",
      "\n",
      "He always understood the level of risks and took them consciously. Both when he directly expressed his position from government tribunes and when he came to the front line to visit fighters in the special operation zone. Obviously, the Ukrainian side could not put up with it, having brought criminal charges against the head of Bashkortostan and the mayor of Ufa in absentia. The pre-trial investigation is being handled by the SBU department in Vinnytsia region. There is no doubt that the case will go to trial and even bring a guilty verdict. But this will not affect Radiy Khabirov's position on the special operation in any way, the administration of the head of the region said. From the legal point of view, we consider this act as a legal nonsense, since a public servant of one state, who selflessly works for the good of his country, protecting its sovereignty and security, is subjected to criminal prosecution in another state. At the same time Radiy Faritovich treats the actions of the prosecutor's office of Ukraine absolutely calmly and will continue to do everything to assist in achieving the goals of the special military operation. Diana Safargaleeva, press secretary of the Head of Bashkortostan. The act of the Ukrainian side both in the administration and among the public is seen as no other than a recognition of Radiy Khabirov's personal contribution in support of the SWO. Experts perceived the message of the Ukrainian Prosecutor General's Office with a certain degree of skepticism and humor. The decision of the Ukrainian authorities has no legal grounds. Article 59 of the constitution states that defense of the fatherland is the duty and obligation of any citizen of the Russian Federation. And according to the current situation, the LNR, DNR, Zaporizhzhya and Kherson regions are part of Russia. This is our legitimate territory, accepted as part of Russia in accordance with international law and Russian legislation, so which subject to help is our internal matter.

      "The West crossed a red line in Ukraine when it promised Ukraine NATO membership in the indefinite future in 2008, according to former General Erich Wade. In an interview with YouTube channel SaneVox Deutsch, Angela Merkel's former military adviser calls the decision of the Bucharest NATO summit a mistake because Moscow will never accept Ukraine into NATO. With Trump in the White House, however, a division of Ukraine into two parts becomes more likely, in which the western part of the country could still end up in NATO. PASCAL LOTTAZ, neutrality researcher: I always present the view and analysis that neutrality is also a very important concept of (political. - INOTV) realism. And I think that neutrality for Ukraine would be \"that solution\". Do you agree with me or not? ERICH WADE, ex-advisor to Angela Merkel: Yes, I think in the past this concept was the right one. The aim was to take into account Russia's security interests, but that path was abandoned in 2014, you know that. Then came the annexation of Crimea* - ultimately it was also a reaction to the fact that from Russia's point of view it was unacceptable that Ukraine eventually started to drift towards NATO membership. I was there myself at the NATO summit in Bucharest in 2008 when Germany and France rejected that very NATO membership. And the mistake, in my view, was to leave that prospect open. For the Russians, it was, as Burns, the American ambassador to Moscow at the time, said, \"just a very dark red line.\" And it remains so to this day. But that time may have passed, and much has happened since then. Former Chancellor Angela Merkel tried to preserve what could be preserved in the Minsk agreements. And that was ultimately defeated. And today we have a new situation. And as for Donald Trump, his mentality... I can imagine that if he becomes president, he'll just call his, quote, \"friend Vladimir\" and say, let's get this over with, let's just divide. And then I don't rule out that Western Ukraine may end up joining NATO under certain conditions. So this is a matter of the future. We may also be heading towards a Korean solution, and the whole thing will remain in limbo. It worked well in Korea with that demarcation line. We'll just have to wait, I'm not clairvoyant. What I don't see is a military solution to this war.\n",
